# CMake Module Organization Summary
# This file documents the organization of the libnd4j CMake modules
################################################################################

# === CREATED CMAKE MODULES ===
# The following .cmake files have been extracted from the main CMakeLists.txt
# and organized into logical functional units:

# 1. TypeValidationExtended.cmake
#    - Enhanced type validation with error handling
#    - Debug type profiles for ML workloads
#    - Type normalization and alias handling
#    - Build impact estimation
#    - Fail-fast validation functions

# 2. PrintingUtilities.cmake  
#    - Colored status printing functions
#    - Debug utilities and variable printing
#    - Template processing verification
#    - File exclusion utilities

# 3. TemplateProcessing.cmake
#    - Template file processing and generation
#    - Compilation unit generation (genCompilation)
#    - Partition combination processing
#    - CUDA single function generation
#    - Template verification functions

# 4. SemanticTypeFiltering.cmake
#    - ML workload-specific type categorization
#    - Semantic validation for type combinations
#    - Type promotion ranking system
#    - Workload-specific filtering (quantization, training, inference, NLP, CV)
#    - Pattern analysis and validation functions

# 5. SemanticPairwiseProcessing.cmake
#    - Enhanced pairwise template processing with semantic filtering
#    - Workload-specific combination generation
#    - Semantic type part macro generation
#    - Pairwise combination partitioning
#    - Integration with traditional template processing

# 6. PlatformOptimizations.cmake
#    - Platform-specific compiler optimizations
#    - Android x86_64 PLT fixes for large template libraries
#    - Memory model configuration
#    - Section splitting and linker optimization
#    - Architecture tuning and compiler-specific flags

# 7. CudaConfiguration.cmake
#    - CUDA language setup and compiler detection
#    - Windows CUDA build configuration
#    - CUDA architecture flag generation
#    - cuDNN detection and configuration
#    - Jetson Nano specific settings
#    - CUDA library discovery

# === USAGE INSTRUCTIONS ===
# To use these modules in the main CMakeLists.txt, add the following includes:

# include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/PrintingUtilities.cmake)
# include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/TypeValidationExtended.cmake)
# include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/TemplateProcessing.cmake)
# include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/SemanticTypeFiltering.cmake)
# include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/SemanticPairwiseProcessing.cmake)
# include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/PlatformOptimizations.cmake)
# include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/CudaConfiguration.cmake)

# === MAIN FUNCTION ENTRY POINTS ===
# Key functions to call from the main CMakeLists.txt:

# From TypeValidationExtended.cmake:
#   - validate_and_process_types_failfast()
#   - SETUP_LIBND4J_TYPE_VALIDATION()

# From SemanticTypeFiltering.cmake:
#   - setup_enhanced_semantic_validation()

# From SemanticPairwiseProcessing.cmake:
#   - setup_semantic_pairwise_processing()

# From PlatformOptimizations.cmake:
#   - setup_platform_optimizations()

# From CudaConfiguration.cmake:
#   - setup_cuda_build() (if SD_CUDA is enabled)

# From TemplateProcessing.cmake:
#   - process_template_files()

# === DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN MODULES ===
# PrintingUtilities.cmake - No dependencies (base utility functions)
# TypeValidationExtended.cmake - Depends on PrintingUtilities.cmake
# SemanticTypeFiltering.cmake - Depends on PrintingUtilities.cmake
# SemanticPairwiseProcessing.cmake - Depends on SemanticTypeFiltering.cmake, PrintingUtilities.cmake
# TemplateProcessing.cmake - Depends on PrintingUtilities.cmake
# PlatformOptimizations.cmake - Depends on PrintingUtilities.cmake
# CudaConfiguration.cmake - Depends on PrintingUtilities.cmake

# === COMPATIBILITY ===
# These modules are designed to work alongside existing cmake files in:
# /home/agibsonccc/Documents/GitHub/deeplearning4j/libnd4j/cmake/
# 
# They do not overlap with existing functionality and provide enhanced
# features for semantic type processing, platform optimization, and
# improved validation.

# === BENEFITS OF THIS ORGANIZATION ===
# 1. Modularity - Each file has a single responsibility
# 2. Maintainability - Easier to find and modify specific functionality
# 3. Reusability - Functions can be used across different build configurations
# 4. Testing - Individual modules can be tested independently
# 5. Documentation - Each module is self-documented with clear purpose
# 6. Extensibility - New features can be added without modifying existing modules
