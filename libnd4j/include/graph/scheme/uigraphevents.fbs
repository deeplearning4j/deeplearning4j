/*
An "Event" is any value that may occur multiple times (score vs. iteration, or accuracy for example)
All events have timestamps and iteration/epoch.

Design: Given given FlatBuffers doesn't support polymorphism, each "frame" in our log file will comprise a sequence of (Event,X) pairs
"Event" is common information/header for the frame (i.e., determines type that follows and allows decoding), and can also be used for filtering - i.e., can skip the next entry

Alternatives:
1. Have a large Event class, with all but 1 of the 'type specific' fields being null (inefficient, especially for things like scalars)
2. Use pair of (ubyte,X) and have duplicate fields in every event subtype

Types of entries that can follow an Event:
array:FlatArray;				//Use standard/existing graph FlatArray class. Also used for scalars! (For types and also strings etc)
arrayList:[FlatArray];			//For TensorArray and the like
histogram:Histogram;			//Histogram class
image:Image;					//Could just use array/FlatArray, but idea is to store more efficiently here in compressed format
summaryStat:SummaryStatistics;	//One class for holding stuff like min/mean/max/stdev etc - more efficiently than a whole lot of separate scalar entries...
opTiming:FlatTiming;			//Timing/profiling information about a single op execution. Use existing FlatTiming, but maybe extend if required
hardwareState:HardwareState;	//Information about hardware at a specific point in time: CPU/GPU utilization, etc
*/


enum UIEventType:byte {
	ADD_NAME,					//Used to register a name (essentialy, Map<Integer,String>.put(i,name)), so it can be referred to by index later. Saves us encoding really long names in every single frame...
	SCALAR,
	ARRAY,
	ARRAY_LIST,
	HISTOGRAM,
	IMAGE,						//To be added later
	SUMMARY_STATISTICS,
	OP_TIMING,
	HARDWARE_STATE
}

/*
UIEventSubtype relates to what the metric is about. This determines where the value should be presented in the UI
For example, we can have scalars for: evaluation, tuning (mean magnitudes), performance (op runtime) etc.
But these should be presented in different sections of the UI.
It can also be thought of as the "semantic type of event" whereas UIEventType is the "data type of event"
