# Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Java

## Expert Systems

An expert system is also called a rules-based system. The rules are typically if-then statements; i.e. if this condition is met, then perform this action. An expert system usually comprises hundreds or thousands of nested if-then statements. Expert systems were a popular form of AI in the 1980s. They are good at modeling static and deterministic relationships; e.g. the tax code. However, they are also brittle and they require manual modification, which can be slow and expensive. Unlike, machine-learning algorithms, they do not adapt as they are exposed to more data. They can be a useful complement to a machine-learning algorithm, codifying the things that should always happen a certain way. 

### Drools

[Drools](https://www.drools.org/) is a business rules management system backed by Red Hat. 

## Deep Learning & Neural Networks

### Deeplearning4j

[Deeplearning4j](deeplearning4j.org) is the most widely used open source deep learning library for Java and the JVM. It also has a Scala API and uses Keras as its Python API for neural network configuration. The official website provides many tutorials and simple theoretical explanations for deep learning and neural networks.

### Neuroph

[Neuroph](http://neuroph.sourceforge.net/) is an open-source Java framework for neural networks. Developers can create neural nets with the Neuroph GUI. The Neuroph API documentation also explains how neural networks work.

## Natural Language Processing

### OpenNLP

[Apache OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/) is a machine-learning toolkit for processing natural language; i.e. text. The official website provides API documentation with information on how to use the library.

### Stanford CoreNLP

[Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) is the most popular Java natural-language processing framework. It provides various tools for NLP tasks. The official website provides tutorials and documentation with information on how to use this framework.

## Machine Learning

### SMILE

[SMILE](https://github.com/haifengl/smile) stands for Statistical and Machine Intelligence Learning Engine. SMILE was create by Haifeng Lee of ADP, and provides fast, scalable machine learning for Java. 

### SINGA

[Apache SINGA](https://singa.incubator.apache.org/en/index.html) is an open-source machine-learning library capable of distributed training, with a focus on healthcare applications. 

### Java Machine Learning Library (Java-ML)

[Java-ML](http://java-ml.sourceforge.net/) is an open source Java framework which provides various machine learning algorithms specifically for programmers. The official website provides API documentation with many code samples and tutorials.

### RapidMiner

[RapidMiner](https://rapidminer.com/) is a data science platform that supports various machine- and deep-learning algorithms through its GUI and Java API. It has a very big community, many available tutorials, and an extensive documentation.

### Weka 

[Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) is a collection of machine learning algorithms that can be applied directly to a dataset, through the Weka GUI or API. The WEKA community is large, providing various tutorials for Weka and machine learning itself.

### Encog Machine Learning Framework

[Encog](http://www.heatonresearch.com/encog/) is a Java machine learning framework that supports many machine learning algorithms. It was developed by Jeff Heaton, of Heaton Research. The official website provides documentation and examples.
