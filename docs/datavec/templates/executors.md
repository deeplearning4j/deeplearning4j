## Local or remote execution?

Because datasets are commonly large by nature, you can decide on an execution mechanism that best suits your needs. For example, if you are vectorizing a large training dataset, you can process it in a distributed Spark cluster. However, if you need to do real-time inference, DataVec also provides a local executor that doesn't require any additional setup.

## Executing a transform process

Once you've created your `TransformProcess` using your `Schema`, and you've either loaded your dataset into a Apache Spark `JavaRDD` or have a `RecordReader` that load your dataset, you can execute a transform.

Locally this looks like:

```java
import org.datavec.local.transforms.LocalTransformExecutor;

List<List<Writable>> transformed = LocalTransformExecutor.execute(recordReader, transformProcess)

List<List<List<Writable>>> transformedSeq = LocalTransformExecutor.executeToSequence(sequenceReader, transformProcess)

List<List<Writable>> joined = LocalTransformExecutor.executeJoin(join, leftReader, rightReader)
```

When using Spark this looks like:

```java
import org.datavec.spark.transforms.SparkTransformExecutor;

JavaRDD<List<Writable>> transformed = SparkTransformExecutor.execute(inputRdd, transformProcess)

JavaRDD<List<List<Writable>>> transformedSeq = SparkTransformExecutor.executeToSequence(inputSequenceRdd, transformProcess)

JavaRDD<List<Writable>> joined = SparkTransformExecutor.executeJoin(join, leftRdd, rightRdd)
```
