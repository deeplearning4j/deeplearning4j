Eric Schmidt: Microsoft Pushes Patent Deals Out Of Fear Of Android
The makers of the Peel iPod phone adapter have outdone themselves. Their new device – called the Vooma Peel PG92 – is a unique case that, in conjunction with a jailbroken iPhone – adds dual SIM capabilities to the iPhone 4 and 4S.
The device itself consists of a back-up battery that can charge your phone and what amounts to a dumbed-down cellphone. When you jailbreak your iPhone and download the Vooma app, you can control the phone inside the case to make calls using an SIM card. In short, it charges, unlocks, and enables dual SIMs for your iPhone.
The model I tested is still in pre-release stage and you can enter your email address at the Vooma website to request more information on the device. Once it’s set up the Peel PG92 works seamlessly and even uses a similar interface to Apple’s own dialer – although it’s clear that the programmers had to cut a few corners to get the look and feel correct. For example, the dialing screen is actually a bitmapped copy of the original dialer and the letters and numbers are slightly warped. However, all of the major functionality is recreated in the Vooma app.
However, this is clearly a very cool and clever hack and it works without problems on any jailbroken iPhone. Because it also ostensibly unlocks your iPhone the PG92 adds quite a bit of value in a package that is little bigger than a standard iPhone case.
