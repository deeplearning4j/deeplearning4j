Subject: FORSALE: NEW HP48SX WITH SOFTWARE.
Organization: University of Illinois at Urbana
Lines: 10

I bought my HP48sx calculator a month ago, used once but put it back in the
box.  Includes manual and I'm including about 7 high density disks packed with
dozens if not hundreds of games and programs. All you need to do is buy the
pc cable for around $20 bucks so you could use the software.
