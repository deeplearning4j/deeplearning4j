Organization: Rice University
Lines: 70

Hey!!! I've just upgraded my laptop to a Windows-capable one, so I 
don't need my DOS word processor anymore.  It's a great word 
processor.  Easy-to-use, undemanding on the system, and
best of all, it has a WYSIWYG EDITING mode.  This is something
Word Perfect doesn't have!!  And all I'm asking is $65 + shipping.
It even comes with several hundred dollars of free utilities!!!

$65 for a full-featured WYSIWYG word processor!!!  Perfect for
a laptop, or a lower powered machine!

Check this out:
CA> It has: 
CA> - WYSIWYG-mode editing (Word Perfect still trying to do
CA> this!) 
CA> - Graphics-importing, scaling, and resizing (Comes
CA> with free art!) 
CA> - Scalable fonts (30 typefaces included!)
CA> Indentical from screen to printer! (See below for more info
CA> on font generator) 
CA> - On-line spell-checking and thesaurus
CA> (See below for more info!) 
CA> - Great 10-level outliner!
CA> - Multiple columns
CA> - Dual-document opening and editing
CA> - Line and box drawing
CA> - Search and replace
CA> - Cut, copy, insert, and paste between documents and inside
CA> documents  
CA> - Justification control
CA> - Resettable margins, tabs, and line-spacing
CA> - Savable layouts
CA> - Headers, footers, page numbering
CA> - Table of Contents
CA> - Multiple rulers in one document
CA> - Mail merge
CA>  
CA> Also included as free utilities:
CA> - Publisher's Powerpak Font Engine: This gives PFS:Write
CA> scalable fonts  in sizes from 4pt to 72pt!  Support for
CA> screen (in Write) and printer  (even 9-pin dot-matrix looks
CA> great!).  Comes with 30 typefaces.  Supports  subscripts and
CA> superscripts, too! 
CA> - Grammatik IV: The grammar and style
CA> checker.  Comes with a quick  reference card for easy use.
CA> It really helped my punctuation and usage! 
CA> - International CorrectSpell English and Roget's Electronic 
CA> Thesaurus: Th dictionary and thesuarus pack is published by 
CA> the publishers of The American Hertiage Dictionary.  If you 
CA> can't trust them with your words, who can you trust?
CA> - ClickArt Business Images: A sampler of the ClickArt
CA> library.  Perfect for importing into PFS:Write documents.
CA>  
CA> I bought this product 1 year ago for $129. Its easy to use
CA> and turns out great-looking documents, even on a dot-matrix 
CA> printer.  So if you  want WYSIWYG editing for your DOS-computer 
CA> now, PFS:Write is here!  
CA>  
CA> I'm looking to get $65.  It comes with full
CA> documentation, registration cards, the box (its still in
CA> good condition), both 5 1/4" and 3 1/2" disks for PFS:Write
CA> and Grammatik, and the ClickArt on a 3 1/2" disk. The
CA> utilities PFS:Write comes with are worth $300 alone, so $65
CA> for a full-featured WP is a REAL BARGAIN.  Buyer pays
CA> shipping.
