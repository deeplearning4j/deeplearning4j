OK.  Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:

02106@chopin.udel.edu or
02106@ravel.udel.edu or
02106@bach.udel.edu or
02106@brahms.udel.edu

NO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!!
LOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!!

Shipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).

For all those who have bought comics from me, thanks!!!

All comics are near mint unless otherwise noted (my books were graded by
mile high comics and other comic professional collectors, not me!)
