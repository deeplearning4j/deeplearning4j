OK... I've done a little research and the price I've been asking
was a BIT high.  So...

	Casio CZ-101 Synthesizer	$125 or best offer

Features:
uses FM modulation to create sounds -- 
	programmable ADSR envelopes for each of 2 DCA's (amplitude), 2 DCW's 
	(pitch, like a VCF), and 2 DCO's (waveform, like VCO) with up to 8 
	steps for each
16 preset sounds, 8 more in memory, 8 more still in RAM cartridge.
49 stubby keys
Pitch Bend Wheel
MIDI in/out ports

Includes:
All the manuals you could ever want
AC adapter (can use 6 D batteries)
Line cord
1 RAM cartridge -- holds 8 additional sounds

I'll throw in a bunch of sheet music and "Play Rock Keyboards" too.
