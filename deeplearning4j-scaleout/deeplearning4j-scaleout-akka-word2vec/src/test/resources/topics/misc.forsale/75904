I have used JVC's top of the line portable cd player for three months now.
I have mostly used it in my car on long trips, so it has less than 20 hours of use on it.  The unit is one of the best that I have seen and listened to, but
I am going to part with it to install a disc changer in my car.

Features include:
	17 Hz - 20,000 Hz
	rechargeable nicad batteries
	wireless remote control
	AC adaptor
	headphones
	carrying belt and case
	digital 6 band graphic eq with spectrum analyzer
		25 presets, 5 user programmable
	RCA connections and cord
	JVC compulink capability (cord included)
	programmable from remote
	intro, random, repeat playback

I will include a Discwasher (tm) power converter to convert an automobile's
12v DC to the 5.5V DC that the unit requires.  I had to buy this one because
it was the only one that fits, (JVC makes a unique connection that cannot be
found at Radio Shack etc).

I paid $235 for the disc player and another $30 for the power converter.
I will sell the disc player alone for $180, or both items for $190.
