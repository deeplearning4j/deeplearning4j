    Storage space for sale:
    
    Iomega 44 MB removeable HD for sale w/ 16 cartridges.
    
    Total storage space comes out to be about 750 MB.  6 cartridges still in
    original shrinkwrapping, unused.  Note:  this is NOT compatible with
    SysQuest 45 cartridges.
    
    SCSI interface required... plugs right into the back of Macintoshes,
    but I don't have a controller for the IBM.  All utilities I have for it
    are for the Mac.  If you have a Mac, then this is for you!  I have a
    ton of software on these disks that I don't use anymore, because I sold
    my mac system.  Stuff included:  Most of the PD stuff from info-mac
    site, LOTS of GIF's, and LOTS of sound effects.  (1 entire disk with
    just sounds)
   
    I am asking $900 for all, plus shipping.

    For more information, send me mail (cxs2341@ultb.isc.rit.edu) or call
    (716) 427-0701... ask for Sawran
    
    cheers
