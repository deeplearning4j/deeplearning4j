I had the good luck to obtain an EICO dynamic conductance 
tube tester for a song. Unfortunately, I was a little out of
key; the only thing wrong with it was an open meter movement.
Does anyone know where I can find either another meter movement
like it, a dead-but-not-the-meter-dead unit, or schematics 
to specify the current scale of the meter movement? I can cut
and paste a more sensitive movement in if I can find what the
full scale current was. Or... is EICO still contactable?

The thing is a model 666 -nope, not a joke or any sort of snide
reference.
