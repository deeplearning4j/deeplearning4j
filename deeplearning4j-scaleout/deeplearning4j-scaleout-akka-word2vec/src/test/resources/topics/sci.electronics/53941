I second that suggestion.  Although I don't own the HP Portable Deskjet,
I *do* own the HP Deskjet 500.  It gives the nicest outputs, with only
a minor loss of quality.   For all intensive purposes (papers, letters,
resumes), I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer (You *do* have to
look a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters).  Only one
grudge, the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in the
presence of moisture (Even though the ink is waterproof).  However,
you would have to spend about $500 more for laser quality.

The cannon bubblejets are nice, however they don't seem to have as
much support (eg: drivers for popular programs) as the HP ink-jets.
Also HP Deskjet (regular,plus,500,500c) accepts xerox paper (I believe
that the cut-sheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet).

If you don't mind refilling your printer with cheap ink (say
fountain-pen ink), then the HP deskjets are *very* cheap to maintain
(I paid $3.50 for my last bottle of ink and I expect it to last 9
months).

PS: I have a question for you netters, I'm too afraid to refill with
the waterproof inks they sell in art-supply houses because I had brought
a bottle of waterproof ink and it clogged up my cartridge. I
wonder what is a 'good' waterproof ink (aside from buying refill-kits)
to refill my cartridge?
