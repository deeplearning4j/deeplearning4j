Re: RMS readings

Unless the DVM *says* it's measuring RMS, it's probably Average voltage.
The input is diode rectified and measured as DC.  If it says it's RMS
and but measures square/triangle/etc.  incorrectly, it's measuring
average and multipling by a correction that's *only* true for sine waves
(i.e.  Vave*(0.707/0.63) = Vrms).  If you want correct RMS for (most)
any waveform, you need a "True-RMS" DVM/DMM which literally does the
Root-Mean-Square calculation in either analog or digital circuitry.

:    Related question (less important to me):
:    What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with 
: analog ones? 

The last significant advantage of analog (IMO) ** was ** being able to
"see" the signal if it was changing over time (e.g.  checking
electrolytic capacitors).

Anymore, most DMM have bargraphs, etc. that duplicate this.
