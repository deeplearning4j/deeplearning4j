Bruce,
	For the latest information on Access.Bus call the Access.Bus
Industry Group at (408) 991-3517.  Also, Sun will be hosting the next
meeting of the group on April 19th, here in Mountain View.  For some reason
I am not able to post to any newsgroups today, so please feel free to pass
this information on yourself as you see fit.
