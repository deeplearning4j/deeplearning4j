I need to find a UART that will interface to an 8051 and do the following:
	-250k baud, 8 data bits, 2 stop bits, no parity
	-ability to do BREAK detect (IRQ or output pin)
	-IRQ on character received

I'm using a Dallas DS2250 at 16 Mhz (8051 clone), but it won't do 
break detect.  I've looked at the 6850, 8251, 7201, 2661, etc...

	Any help would be appriciated!!!
