Yes.

I use 74HC4066 and others commerically for this purpose so rest assured it 
works fine. In one case I route bit serial digital audio using these and it 
is difficult to see any signal degradation at all which surprised me given 
some pretty fast edges. HC4066 is spec'd at something like -3dB @ 200MHz into 
50 ohms. The more complex types are generally a little slower and more 
resistive.

Plain 4000 series are not so good at handling 5v logic.

Remember that the output load is seen by the input device.
