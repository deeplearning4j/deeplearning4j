MJM>HI, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related
MJM>subjects. I am currently learning about AM/FM receivers and recieving
MJM>circuits. I understand a lot of things ,but a few things I am confused
MJM>abuot. The first is the MIXER, to mix the RF and local oscillator
MJM>frequencies to make the IF. Does anyone have any cicruit diagrams (as
MJM>simple as possible) for this kind of mixer? I have come across a
MJM>MC-SBL mixer chip But I have not been able to find it in any catalogs
MJM>(ACTIVE,etc...)

MJM>Along the same note, are there any SIMPLE fm receiver circuits anyone
MJM>may have stashed away somewhere and they couold let me see?.

MJM>P.S. any REALLY GOOD BOOKS on AM/FM theory ALONG WITH DETAILED
MJM>ELECTRICAL DIAGRAMS would help a lot.
MJM>I have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of
MJM>circuit books with no theory, but one without the other does not help.

Digi-key has the NE-622 chip which has a local oscillator and mixer on
one chip.

For a great combination of theory with actual circuits, the best
reference for non-engineers is probably the Radio Amateur's Handbook
from the ARRL.  Most library's have it in the reference section.
