A surplus-dealing buddy of mine came up with two emulator pods:

	HP64220C (for HP 64100 development station). 8086 target
	processor. DIP head. Does not include board that plugs into
	the 64100.

	Applied Microsystems 80C186/188 pod, LCC head.

If you have an interest in either, let me know. They look to
be in excellent condition. He doesn't know what to do with them, which
may mean that they'll be cheap.
