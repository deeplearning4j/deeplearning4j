It sounds like your TV is one of the ones that also reacts to the video 
protection.  (Poor you!)

The Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you 
souldn't have any more problems.  However, if you use the method of 
copying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to 
the protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the 
protection.

One thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape 
for viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an 
extra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR 
first, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I 
don't know if they would react or not.  Just to be safe, you might want 
to make sure that you have NOTHING between the VCR and TV.
