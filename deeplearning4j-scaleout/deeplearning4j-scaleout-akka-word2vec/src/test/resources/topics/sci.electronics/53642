$50 each!!  Don't bother trying to make one yourself, just shop around a
little.  I've found DOD brand DI boxes for as cheap as $20 each.  You can 
get higher end ones for more, but for PA use for bands, I wouldn't bother.
Making one yourself might work, but getting a sturdy enough enclosure might
be hard (they're made of heavy guage metal, since they're always on the floor,
being kicked around a lot). For any additional questions on this topic, you 
might want to post to rec.audio.pro
