I've used on-chip capacitors to reduce ground-bounce noise on a small
systolic array chip that had 50pF loads on the clock lines.
(Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.)
Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:

1) They don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is
	still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the
	load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground
	return), so you still get ground and power line bounce. 

2) They do help a lot with on-chip loads, as I had with the high load
	on the clock lines. 

3) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high
	frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff
	capacitors, since the RC time constant is too large.
	What I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich,
	but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent
	diff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly
	lines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probably
	omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,
	using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high
	resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).

4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with
	slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for
	output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.
	I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for
	a MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I
	needed.

Due to budgetary constraints the light at the end of the tunnel is
being turned off.
