I built a little project using the radio shack 5vdc relays to switch
audio.  I got pretty bad 'clicks' when the thing switched.  I was doing
most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and
nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks.


My question is:

	Is there a good relay/relay circuit that I can use for switching
audio, so that there will be *NO* noise of any kind on the audio lines.


I will appreciate any advice or references to advice.  Also, exact part
numbers/company names etc. for the relays will help!

Thanks!
