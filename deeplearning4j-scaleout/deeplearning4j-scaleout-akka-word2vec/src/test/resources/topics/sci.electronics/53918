I have the ARRL Handbook for the Radio AMateur, and I'm getting the
Solid STate Design for the Radio Amateur.

The handbook is $25 and Solid State is $12 from ARRL, 225 Main, Newington,
CT 06111 but you should be able to find them at electronics or amateur radio
stores.
ARRL will want $5 or so for shipping.
Good Luck,
Galen Watts, KF0YJ
