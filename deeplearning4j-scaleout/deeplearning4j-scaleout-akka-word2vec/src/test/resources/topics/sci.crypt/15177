<4.1> What UNIX programs are related to privacy?

  For more information, type `man [cmd]' or `apropos [keyword]' at the
  UNIX shell prompt.

    passwd - change password
    finger - obtain information about a remote user
    chfn   - change information about yourself obtainable by remote
             users (sometimes `passwd -f')
    chmod  - change the rights associated with a file or directory
    umask  - (shell) change the default (on creation) file access
             rights
    ls     - list the rights associated with files and directories
    xhost  - allow or disable access control of particular users to an
             Xwindow server
    last   - list the latest user logins on the system and their
             originations
    who    - list other users, login/idle times, originations
    w      - list other users and what they are running
    xhost  - access control list for X Window client use
    xauth  - control X Window server authentication
    
    .signature  - file in the home directory appended to USENET posts
    .forward    - file used to forward email to other accounts
    .Xauthority - file used for X Window server authentication keys
    $SIGNATURE  - variable used for name in email and USENET postings

  The 'tcpdump' packet-tracing program is loosely based on SMI's
  "etherfind" although none of the etherfind code remains.  It was
  originally written by Van Jacobson, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,
  as part of an ongoing research project to investigate and improve
  tcp and internet gateway performance.  A current version is
  available via anonymous ftp from host ftp.ee.lbl.gov (currently at
  address 128.3.254.68) file tcpdump.tar.Z (a compressed Unix tar
  file). This program is subject to  the 'standard' Berkeley network
  software copyright.

_____
<4.2> How can I learn about or use cryptography?

  A general introduction to mostly theoretical cryptographic issues,
  especially those frequently discussed in sci.crypt, is available
  in FAQ form:

  >  Compiled by:
  >        cme@ellisun.sw.stratus.com (Carl Ellison)
  >        Gwyn@BRL.MIL (Doug Gwyn)
  >        smb@ulysses.att.com (Steven Bellovin)

  NIST (U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology)
  publishes an introductory paper on cryptography, special
  publication 800-2 ``Public-Key Cryptograhy'' by James Nechvatal
  (April 1991).  Available via anonymous FTP from
  csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (129.6.54.11), file pub/nistpubs/800-2.txt. 
  Also via available anonymous FTP from wimsey.bc.ca as crypt.txt.Z
  in the crypto directory.  Covers technical mathematical aspects
  of encryption such as number theory.

  More general information can be found in a FAQ by Paul Fahn of RSA
  Labortories via anonymous FTP from rsa.com in /pub/faq.ps.Z.  See
  the `readme' file for information on the `tex' version.  Also
  available as hardcopy for $20 from   RSA Laboratories, 100 Marine
  Parkway, Redwood City, CA  94065.  Send questions to
  faq-editor@rsa.com.

  Phil Zimmerman's PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) public-domain package
  for public key encryption is available at numerous sites, and is
  in widespread use over the internet for general UNIX-based file
  encryption (including email).  Consult the archie FTP database. 
  Also see the newsgroup alt.security.pgp.  Mailing list requests
  to info-pgp-request@lucpul.it.luc.edu.

  From the RIPEM FAQ by Marc VanHeyningen
  <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu> on news.answers:

  > RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)
  > using the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows
  > your electronic mail to have the properties of authentication
  > (i.e. who sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can
  > read it except the intended recipient.)
  > 
  > RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan
  > <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>. Most of the code is in the public domain,
  > except for the RSA routines, which are a library called RSAREF
  > licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.
  > 
  > RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent
  > residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the
  > README file for info.
  > 
  > RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its `home site' on
  > rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in
  > the U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To
  > find out how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and
  > read the file GETTING_ACCESS.

  Note: cryptography is generally not well integrated into email yet
  and some system proficiency is required by users to utilize it.

_____
<4.3> What is the cypherpunks mailing list?

  Eric Hughes <hughes@toad.com> runs the `cypherpunk' mailing list
  dedicated to ``discussion about technological defenses for privacy
  in the digital domain.''  Send email to
  cypherpunks-request@toad.com to be added or subtracted from the
  list. From the charter:

  > The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption.
  > To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  But to encrypt
  > with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for
  > privacy. Cypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will
  > learn how best to defend it.

<4.7> How can I run an anonymous remailer?

  Cypherpunk remailer source is at soda.berkeley.edu in the
  /pub/cypherpunks directory.  It's written in PERL, and is
  relatively easy to install (no administrative rights are required).
  Karl Barrus  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> has more information and
  modifications. Also, most remailer operators mentioned above are
  amenable to discussing features, problems, and helping new sites
  become operational. Address all points in the section
  ``responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to
  advertising your service.  You should be committed to the long-term
  stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously.

<5.1> What is ``digital cash''?

  With digital encryption and authentication technologies, the
  possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be
  realized.  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks
  (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may
  be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and
  anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an
  economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum
  (~Dec.1992).

  An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus
  <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the
  cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to
  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:

    ::
    command: help
    
    user@host

  where `user@host' is your email address.
 
  
_____
<5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?

  These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,
  especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past
  a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as
  breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most
  internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a
  ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,
  curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a
  system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and
  patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also
  the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.
 
 
_____
<5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?

  From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:

  > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were
  > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy
  > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,
  > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant
  > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people
  > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,
  > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek
  > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or
  > their opinions.

  See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.

  See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary
  in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.

_____
<5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?

  Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the
  techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication
  but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself. 
  Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the
  proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible
  to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,
  typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is
  posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually
  untraceable  communication can take place between sender and
  receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic
  realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where
  individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual
  users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An
  anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman
  (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to
  <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following
  commands in the subject line:

    subscribe
    unsubscribe
    help

_____
<5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?

  `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain
  protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information
  or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make
  public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade
  `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be
  concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in
  operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that
  some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious
  because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This
  argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet
  posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a
  very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at
  worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ
  for alt.security.  
  
  Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic
  Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First
  International Symposium on National Security & National
  Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:

  > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep
  > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's
  > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If
  > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there
  > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I
  > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into
  > an environment where any information which is at all interesting
  > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little
  > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,
  > but you may differ...

_____
<5.6> What are `identity daemons'?
  
  RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to
  query a remote user's login name after connection to a local
  communication socket (a connection of this type is established
  during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not
  widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement
  it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to
  anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system
  adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a
  trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.

_____
<5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?


  Remailing/Posting
  -----------------
  
  - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,
    publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.
  - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET
    postings.
  - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information
    obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,
    encrypted addresses, etc.)
  - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and
    remailer site chaining.
  
  General
  -------
  
  - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy
    shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the
    general public and their governments.
  - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies 
    by systems designers into
    hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'
    `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.
  - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than
    wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement
    agencies.
  - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government
    agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to
    strengthening and protecting it.

  > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic
  > media which connect us.  Computer-based communication media like
  > electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis
  > of new forms of community.  These communities without a single,
  > fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an
  > electronic frontier.
  > 
  > While well-established legal principles and cultural norms give
  > structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like
  > newspapers, books, and telephones, the new digital media do not
  > so easily fit into existing frameworks.  Conflicts come about as
  > the law struggles to define its application in a context where
  > fundamental notions of speech, property, and place take
  > profoundly new forms. People sense both the promise and the
  > threat inherent in new computer and communications technologies,
  > even as they struggle to master or simply cope with them in the
  > workplace and the home.
  > 
  > The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been established to help
  > civilize the electronic frontier; to make it truly useful and
  > beneficial not just to a technical elite, but to everyone; and to
  > do this in a way which is in keeping with our society's highest
  > traditions of the free and open flow of information and
  > communication.
  
  EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor, founder of
  Lotus software, and John Barlow, lyricist for the Grateful Dead
  rock band.  A highly publicized endeavor of the organization
  involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI
  raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``Steve
  Jackson Games'').  The foundation publishes EFF News (EFFector
  Online) electronically, send requests to effnews-request@eff.org.
  
  In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee
  with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated
  November 5, 1991,  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented
  Mitchell Kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national
  public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly
  by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' (complete text in 
  ftp.eff.com:/pub/pub-infra/1991-12):

  > ...we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to
  > work with other sectors of the communications industry to create
  > a consumer-oriented, public information network. Please let me or
  > my staff know what policies you and others in the computer
  > industry believe would best serve the public interest in creating
  > a reasonably priced, widely available network in which
  > competition is open and innovation rewarded.  I also want to
  > learn what lessons from the computer industry over the past ten
  > to fifteen years should apply to the current debate on
  > structuring the information and communications networks of the
  > future....I ask your help in gaining input from the computer
  > industry so that the Subcommittee can shape policies that will
  > bring this spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship to the
  > information services industry.

<6.2> Who are Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)?

  The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility have been
  working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues
  since ~1982.  The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,
  Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation
  against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other
  U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation
  on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,
  NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in
  Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on
  Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to
  testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and
  caller identification.

  CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available
  via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising
  the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For
  more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.

<6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?

  In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies
  on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in
  such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.
  
  (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):

  > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May
  > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card
  > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success. 
  > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying
  > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of
  > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some
  > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department
  > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide
  > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of
  > jurisdictions.

  Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated
  instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a
  crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal
  search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of
  Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST
  by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science
  Fiction Magazine:

  > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional
  > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the
  > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared
  > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,
  > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin
  > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only
  > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place. 
  > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that
  > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document
  > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.

  FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed
  on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier
  Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe
  Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:
  
  > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret
  > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal
  > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a
  > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,
  > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment. 
  > 
  > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in
  > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,
  > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke
  > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer
  > seizure policies.  While the Service has seized dozens of
  > computers since the crackdown began in 1990, this is the first
  > case to challenge the practice. 
  > 
  > Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin
  > science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never
  > suspected of a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal
  > research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and
  > the suspected illegal activities of an employee, or to determine
  > that the company was a publisher. Indeed, agents testified that
  > they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the
  > special Secret Service school on computer crime. 
  > 
  > "How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what
  > Steve Jackson Games did, what it was?" asked Sparks. "An hour? 
  > 
  > "Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to
  > Steve Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything
  > taken? 
  > 
  > "Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had
  > a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen
  > -- saying he was a computer crime suspect? 
  > 
  > "Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material
  > could harm Steve Jackson economically?" 
  > 
  > Foley replied, "No, sir," but the judge offered his own answer. 
  > 
  > "You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go
  > out and hire a lawyer and sue you." 
  > 
  > More than $200,000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier 
  > Foundation in bringing the case to trial. The EFF was founded by 
  > Mitchell Kapor amid a civil liberties movement sparked in large
  > part by the Secret Service computer crime crackdown.

<6.4> What is Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)?

  ISDN is a high-speed data communications standard that utilizes
  existing copper telephone lines, and is a possible inexpensive and
  intermediate alternative to laying fiber optic cable for phone
  networks.  The speeds involved may be sufficient for audio and
  video transmission applications.  G. V. der Leun in the file
  ftp.eff.org: /pub/pub-infra/1991-11:

  > Telecommunications in the United States is at a crossroads.  With
  > the Regional Bell Operating Companies now free to provide
  > content, the shape of the information networking is about to be
  > irrevocably altered.  But will that network be the open,
  > accessible, affordable network that the American public needs? 
  > You can help decide this question.
  > 
  > The Electronic Frontier Foundation recently presented a plan to
  > Congress calling for the immediate deployment of a national
  > network based on existing ISDN technology, accessible to anyone
  > with a telephone connection, and priced like local voice service.
  >  We believe deployment of such a platform will spur the
  > development of innovative new information services, and maximize
  > freedom, competitiveness, and civil liberties throughout the
  > nation.
  > 
  > The EFF is testifying before Congress and the FCC; making
  > presentations to public utility commisions from Massachusetts to
  > California; and meeting with representatives from telephone
  > companies, publishers, consumer advocates, and other stakeholders
  > in the telecommunications policy debate.
  > 
  > The EFF believes that participants on the Internet, as pioneers on
  > the electronic frontier, need to have their voices heard at this
  > critical moment.

<6.6> What is the FBI's proposed Digital Telephony Act?

  ``Providers of electronic communication services and private branch
  exchange operators shall provide within the United States
  capability and capacity for the government to intercept wire and
  electronic communications when authorized by law...''
  
  From `BBS Legislative Watch: FBIs Wiretapping Proposal Thwarted' by
  S. Steele in Boardwatch Magazine, Feb. 1993, p. 19-22:
 
  > In a move that worried privacy experts, software manufacturers and
  > telephone companies, the FBI proposed legislation to amend the
  > Communications Act of 1934 to make it easier for the Bureau to
  > perform electronic wiretapping. The proposed legislation,
  > entitled 'Digital Telephony,' would have required communications
  > service providers and hardware manufacturers to make their
  > systems 'tappable' by providing 'back doors' through which law
  > enforcement officers could intercept communications. Furthermore,
  > this capability would have been provided undetectably, while the
  > communications was in progress, exclusive of any communications
  > between other parties, regardless of the mobility of the target
  > of the FBI's investigation, and without degradation of service.
  >  
  > ...under the proposal, the Department of Justice (DOJ) can keep
  > communications products off the market if it determines that
  > these products do not meet the DOJ's own ... guidelines. This
  > [could] result in increased costs and reduced competitiveness for
  > service providers and equipment manufacturers, since they will be
  > unlikely to add any features that may result in a DOJ rejection
  > of their entire product. ...the FBI proposal suggests that the
  > cost of this wiretapping 'service' to the Bureau would have to be
  > borne by the service provider itself...
  > 
  > The Electronic Frontier Foundation organized a broad coalition of
  > public interest and industry groups, from Computer Professionals
  > for Social Responsibilty (CPSR) and the ACLU to AT&T and Sun
  > Microsystems, to oppose the legislation. A white paper produced
  > by the EFF and ratified by the coalition, entitled, `An Analysis
  > of the FBI Digital Telephony Proposal,' was widely distributed
  > throughout the Congress.  ... The Justice Department lobbied hard
  > in the final days to get Congress to take up the bill before
  > Congress adjourned, but the bill never ... found a Congressional

<7.1> What is the background behind the Internet?
 
  The article ``Internet'' in Fantasy and Science Fiction by Bruce
  Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> contains general and nontechnical
  introductory notes on origins of the Internet, including the role
  of the RAND corporation, the goal of network resilience in face of
  nuclear attack, MIT, UCLA, ARPANET, TCP/IP, NSF, NREN, etc.:

  > ARPANET itself formally expired in 1989, a happy victim of its 
  > own overwhelming success.  Its users scarcely noticed, for
  > ARPANET's  functions not only continued but steadily improved. 
  > The use of  TCP/IP standards for computer networking is now
  > global.  In 1971, a  mere twenty-one years ago, there were only
  > four nodes in the  ARPANET  network.  Today there are tens of
  > thousands of  nodes in  the Internet,  scattered over forty-two
  > countries, with more coming  on-line every day.   Three million,
  > possibly four million people use  this gigantic
  > mother-of-all-computer-networks.   
  > 
  > The Internet is especially popular among scientists, and is 
  > probably the most important scientific instrument of the late 
  > twentieth century.   The  powerful, sophisticated access that it 
  > provides to specialized data and personal communication  has sped
  > up the pace of scientific research enormously.  
  > 
  > The Internet's pace of growth in the early 1990s is  spectacular, 
  > almost ferocious.  It is spreading faster than cellular phones,
  > faster  than fax machines.  Last year the Internet was growing at
  > a rate of  twenty percent a *month.*  The number of `host'
  > machines with direct  connection to TCP/IP has been doubling
  > every year since  1988.   The Internet is moving out of  its
  > original base in military and  research institutions,  into
  > elementary and high schools, as well as into  public libraries
  > and the commercial sector.

  > it makes a certain deep and basic sense.  It's rather like the 
  > `anarchy' of the English language.  Nobody rents English, and
  > nobody  owns English.    As an English-speaking person, it's up

  > Otherwise, everybody just sort of  pitches in, and somehow the

  > interesting.   Fascinating, even.   Though a lot  of people earn

  > `English' as an institution is public property, a public good.  
  > Much the same goes for the Internet.   Would English  be improved

  > There'd probably be  a lot fewer new words in English, and a lot

<7.3> Most Wanted list

  Hopefully you have benefitted from this creation, compilation, and
  condensation of information from various sources regarding privacy,
  identity, and anonymity on the internet.  The author is committed
  to keeping this up-to-date and strengthening it, but this can only
  be effective with your feedback.  In particular, the following
  items are sought:
  
  - Short summaries of RFC documents and other references listed,
    esp. CPSR files.
  - More data on the specific uses and penetration of RFC-931.
  - Internet traffic statistics.  How much is email?  How much
    USENET?  What are the costs involved?
  - Famous or obscure examples of compromised privacy
    on the internet.
        - FTP site for the code (NOT the code) to turn the .plan file into a
                named pipe for sensing/reacting to remote `fingers'.
  - Knowledge on the `promiscuous' mode of receipt or transmission 
    on network  cards.
  - Details on the infamous experiment where a scientist resubmitted 
    previously accepted papers to a prominent journal with new and
    unknown authors that were subsequently rejected.
  - X Windows, EFF, CPSR FAQhood in news.answers.
  
  Commerical use of this document is negotiable and is a way for the
  author to recoup from a significant time investment. Email feedback
  to ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu.  Please note where you saw
  this (which newsgroup, etc.).
