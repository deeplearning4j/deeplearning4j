Uh, I notice he has not either asked for or allowed public input, and he damn
sure has not stopped it...

Again, if it was something Clinton didn't like, how come he did not
stop it, or get PUBLIC input before implimenting the DECISION?  He
sure has asserted his authority on other things he did not agree with
from the Bush administrationk, I notice.   He is the president, therefore
he is RESPONSIBLE for the actions of the Execuitive Branch.  I have
not the slightest bit of doubt you would be holding Bush or Reagan
to that standard had they been in office when this thing was cast into
stone...

Thanks for the name-calling.  That really makes your position higly
credible.  Lenin had a term for folks with your outlook.  Do you REALLY
have THAT MUCH faith in the trustworthiness and honesty of the government
that is primarily concerned with people control?   I suspect you will
be in for an unpleasant surprise.  I would just as soon see this nipped
in the bud while/if it still can be done, instead of waiting for yet
more abridgements of our Bill of Rights, thank you...
