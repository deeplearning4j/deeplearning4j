All I have to say is this is full of shit.  I have negotiated a license
and the bucks are incredibly reasonable with an upfront charge on a
sliding scale depending on your capitalization.  If you are a startup
and can't afford it you can't afford to start up in the first place.
Why do people insist on making unequivocal statements about that which
they know nothing.

Have you considered treatment for paranoia?  The government is the
single biggest thorn in RSA's side.

That was exactly its purpose if you know anything about it.  There is
nothing at all preventing the average citizen using it, only selling
it.

It is and you are wrong yet you emotionally state a bunch of crap as fact
with a tiny disclaimer at the end.  Check your facts first and grow up.
Why is there such a strong correlation between interest in cryptography
and immaturity I wonder.
