[not very comprehensive list deleted]

There is a very comprehensive list in sci.math.symbolic, 
which detailed descriptions of many packages. 
(Especially you, Mark, should update your list :-) )
Here it is: 


			Available    Systems

This is the  list of  currently  developed  and   distributed  software  for 
symbolic math applications. No informations is supplied on systems no longer 
being supported like: SAINT, FORMAC, ALPAK, ALTRAN, MATHLAB, SIN, SAC, CAMAL, 
ScratchPad, MuMath, SHEEP, TRIGMAN, ANALITIK, SMP or CCALC.

For more detailed info on any of the systems below,  look into the directory
pub/Symbolic_Math in the anonymous FTP of "math.berkeley.edu". No particular 
recommendation is made for any of these.      If you want prices contact the 
company. Programs are listed by (aprox.) the reverse order of the number  of 
machines they run on, in each class, general purpose systems first.

If you have any information to add to this list (we know we are missing
MuPAD & FELIX) please send it to :
