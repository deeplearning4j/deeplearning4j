Well, after a lot of trawling through archives, I found the post
I reproduce in full below.  Is it time to get together to develop
a tcp/ip standard for crypto voice that we could then layer on
point-to-point SLIP as *the* free standard for crypto voice like
pgp is for mail?

(PS Note the date of this post.  Appropriate, huh? :-) )

In case you'd like to experiment with CELP, you can obtain a software
implementation of the 4800 bps Fed Std CELP coder for free:

The U.S. DoD's Federal-Standard-1016 based 4800 bps code excited linear
prediction voice coder version 3.2 (CELP 3.2) Fortran and C simulation source
codes are now available for worldwide distribution at no charge (on DOS
diskettes, but configured to compile on Sun SPARC stations) from:

Bob Fenichel
National Communications System
Washington, D.C.  20305
1-703-692-2124
1-703-746-4960 (fax)

In addition to the source codes, example input and processed speech files
are included along with a technical information bulletin to assist in
implementation of FS-1016 CELP.  (An anonymous ftp site is being considered
for future releases.)

Copies of the actual standard "Federal Standard 1016, Telecommunications:
Analog to Digital Conversion of Radio Voice by 4,800 bit/second Code
Excited Linear Prediction (CELP)" are available for $2.50 each from:

GSA Rm 6654
7th & D St SW

The following articles describe the Federal-Standard-1016 4.8-kbps CELP
coder (it's unnecessary to read more than one):
