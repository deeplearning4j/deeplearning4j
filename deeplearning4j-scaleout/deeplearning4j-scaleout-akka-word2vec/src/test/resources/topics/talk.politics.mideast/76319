Trumpets, please.

"Forced to go to Palestine."  How dreadful.  Unlike other
undesirables/Jews, she wasn't forced to go into a gas chamber, forced
under a bulldozer, thrown into a river, forced into a "Medical
experiment" like a rat, forced to march until she dropped dead, burned
to nothingness in a crematorium.  Your mother was "forced to go to
Palestine."  You have our deepest sympathies.

We are pleased to hear of your escape.  At least you won't have to
suffer the same fate that your mother did.

Your homeland, Palestine?

Should we assume that you are refering here to Jews who were kicked
out of their homes in Jerusalem during the Jordanian Occupation of
East Jerusalem?  These are the same people who are now being called
thieves for re-claiming houses that they once owned and lived in and
never sold to anyone?

I have never heard of NOT being a Jew as a crime.  Certainly in
Israel, there is no such crime.  In some times and places BEING a Jew
is a crime, but NOT being a Jew??!!

>My conscience does not accept such injustice, period. 

Our brains do not accept your logic, yet, either.

The way you've written this, you seem to accept criticism in the Arab
world UNLESS it deflects criticism from Israel, in which case, we have
to presume, you no longer support criticism of the Arab world.

>The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.

Look who's taling about discrimination now!

Be careful.  You are starting to sound like Barfling.

Good.  Don't call yourself "ARF" or "the Center for Policy Research",
either.
