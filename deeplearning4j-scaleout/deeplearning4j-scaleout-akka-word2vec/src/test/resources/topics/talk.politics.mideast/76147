Obviously, you really don't know.

They *have* spoken out (cf Sec'y of State Christopher's recent trip to the ME),
they have provided millions in aid, and they have participated in the airlifts
to Sarajevo.  They *would* supply military aid, if the UN would lift the embargo 
on arms sales.

See above.  (Kuwait has directly participated in the airlift of food to
Sarajevo.)

"oil rich", "loaded with petro-dollars", etc so they don't count.
