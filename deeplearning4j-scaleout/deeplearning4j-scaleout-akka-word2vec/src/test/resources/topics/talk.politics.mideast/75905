Smart indeed.  If what you're saying is true, Greeks who visit are happy,
the Turkish merchants are happy; who is harmed?  No one.  So not only was
it a smart move, it was also a good move for it adds to the happiness of
200.000 Greeks per week and however many Turkish merchants they interact with.
One simple move in the paperwork arena -> lotsa happy people of both 
nationalities.  Just and observation.

cheers,
