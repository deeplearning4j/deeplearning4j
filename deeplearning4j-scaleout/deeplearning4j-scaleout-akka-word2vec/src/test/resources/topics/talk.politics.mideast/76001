Maybe I'm a bit old-fashioned, but have you heard about something
called Love? It used to play some role in people's considerations
for getting married. Of course I know some people who married 
fictitiously in order to get a green card, but making a common
child for 18,000$? The power of AA is limited. Your proposal is
indeed unconventional.
