Proven?  Maybe not.  But it can certainly be verified beyond a reasonable doubt.  This
statement and statements like it are a matter of public record.  Before the Six Day War (1967)
I think Nasser and some other Arab leaders were broadcasting these statements on
Arab radio.  You might want to check out some old newspapers Ahmed.

I think if you take a look at the Hamas covenant (written in 1988) you might get a 
different impression.  I have the convenant in the original arabic with a translation
that I've verified with Arabic speakers.  The document is rife with calls to kill jews
and spread Islam and so forth.
