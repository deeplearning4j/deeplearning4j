Elias' initial statement certain *is* hot air. But it seems to be
almost standard procedure around here to first throw out an absurb,
overstated image in order to add extra "meaning" to the posting's
*real point*. 

However, his second statement *is* quite real. The essential sealing off
of Gaza residents from the possibility of making a living *has happened*.
Certainly, the Israeli had a legitimate worry behind the action they took,
but isn't that action a little draconian?
