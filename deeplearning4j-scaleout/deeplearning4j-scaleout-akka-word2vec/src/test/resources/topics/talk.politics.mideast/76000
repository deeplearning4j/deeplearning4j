Hi Brad,

I have two comments:  Regarding your hope that the "occupation will end... 
belive that stiff resistance..etc. - how about an untried approach, i.e.,
peace and cooperation.  I can't help but wonder what would happen if all
violence against Israelis stopped.  Hopefully, violence against Arabs
would stop at the same time.  If a state of non-violence could be 
maintained, perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved, i.e.,
greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the
"territories".  

Of course, given the current leadership of Israel, your way may work
also - but if that leadership changes, e.g., to someone with Ariel
Sharon's mentality, then I would predict a considerable loss of life,
i.e., no winners.

Secondly, regarding your comment about the U.S. troops responding
to "stiff resistance" - the analogy is not quite valid.  The U.S.
troops could get out of the neighborhood altogether.  The Israelis
could not.

Just my $.02 worth, no offense intended.

Respectfully,     

Ben.
