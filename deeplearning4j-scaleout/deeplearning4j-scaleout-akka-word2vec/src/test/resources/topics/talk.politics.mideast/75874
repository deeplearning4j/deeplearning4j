     In his neverending effort to make sure that we do not forget         
     what a moron he is, Brad Hernlem has asked why Israel rarely
     abides by UN Security Council resolutions.  Perhaps the list
     below might answer the question.

     It appears that Brad Hernlem and the United Nations Security
     Council have something in common.  They both seem unfettered 
     by the demands of acting on principle.
