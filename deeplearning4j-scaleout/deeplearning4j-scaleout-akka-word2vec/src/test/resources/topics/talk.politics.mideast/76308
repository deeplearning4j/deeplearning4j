^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I've heard many Turks say this and it surpises me that they don't read about
it.Remember the Treaty of Sevres-as a consequence of being in the Axis powers
in WWI.The Turks UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW were supposed to look after their
minorities ie. Greeks,Armenians,Kurds(I must say Turk-Kurd relations are 
improving slightly with time) and not pose a threat to Turkey's neighbours.
The Turks blatantly rejected this treaty(the Germans grudgingly accepted 
Versailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the 
German people).The Greeks who had an army there,were there with BRITISH
and FRENCH backing to enforce Sevres.
    In possibly the first example of appeasement the Young Turk government
managed screwed the Treaty of Laussane out of the weak allies,this was after 
the Greek forces were were destroyed at Smyrna.When this occurred incidently,
FRENCH warships were in the harbour and many Greeks trying escape swam to the 
FRENCH warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the FRENCH
as they clawed they're way up the sides of the ships.
Libertae,egalitae,fraternatae.
