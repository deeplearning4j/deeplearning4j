The following flyer was distributed at AIPAC's 34th annual Policy Conference:

Because when we're not in Israel, we're told to go back where we came from and
when we come back to Israel we're told to go back to where we came from and 
when we're vocal we have too much influence and when we are quiet we can afford
to be because we we control everything anyway and when we buy something we can
afford to because Jews are so rich and when we don't buy something it's because
we're cheap and because when we are poor we're called dirty Jew and ignorant
and when we're not we're called called rich Jew and JAP and when we are visibly
organized it's because there is a secret Jewish conspiracy and when we're not it
is because there is a secret Jewish conspiracy and because we're told we're not
a people and when we say we are we're still told that we're not and when we
marry our own people we're called racist and we don't we're contaminating 
someone else's "race" and because we're under fire from the Left and from the 
Right and because there are whites who hate us for not being white and because
there are non-whites who hate us for being white  and because anti-semitic 
incidents are rising every year but we're told that anti-semitism doesn't 
exist or that we're paranoid and because we're told to shut up about the 
Holocaust and yet Holocaust revisionism is risng every year and when we are
"obnoxious" we're called JAPs and when we are "nice" we're told we don't act
Jewish and because anti-semitism is now world-wide and because our people is
not yet free and because we do not have to complete the work but neither are
we free to desist from it for these reasons and many many more we are part of
the Jewish National Liberation Movement: ZIONISM.
