Is there any Israeli a civilian, in your opinion ?

Now, I do not condone myself bombing villages, any kind of villages.
But you claim these are villages with civilians, and Iraelis claim they are 
camps filled with terrorists. You claim that israelis shell the villages with the
'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad, 
civilians die, right ? I am not so sure. 

As somebody wrote, Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting
manner. And he also claimed 'civilians murdered'. Let me ask you, isn't there 
at least a slight chance that you (not only, and the question is very general, 
no insult) are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in
southern Lebanon ?

Now, a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil' kind of Mediteranean sea.
How do you define Israeli soil ? From what you say, if you do not clearly 
recognize the state of Israel, you condone killing israelis anywhere.

I do not know what was the pupose of the action you describe. If it was 
to kill civilians (I doubt), I certainly DO NOT CONDONE IT. If civilians were 
killed, i do not condone it.

Mr. Hernlem, it was YOU, not ME, who was showing a huge satisfaction for 3 
israelis (human beings by most standards, Don't know about your standards) killed.

If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a 
question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing
justifies murder. I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make
similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ? Am I wrong ?


Now tell me, did you also condone Saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in, let's
say, Tel Aviv ? From what I understand, a lot of palestineans cheered. What does
it show? It does not qualify for freedom fighting to me ? But again, I may be 
wrong, and the jewish controlled media distorted the information, and I am just
an ignorant victim of the media, like most of us.
