Why retract your accusation that he's a liar?  If Omran retracts his "verbal
diarrohea" doesn't that only prove the liar he *really* is?  A retraction
would be pointless!  Giving this guy the opportunity to "save face" after
uttering such bullshit would just encourage him to do it again!  I must say
that your style is very impressive, Mark.  Keep it up!
