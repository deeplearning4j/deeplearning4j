[KT] HELLO, shit face david, I see that you are still around. I dont want to 
[KT] see your shitty writings posted here man. I told you.

So ... close your eyes and walk away.

[KT] You are getting itchy as your fucking country.

I have been defending the history of the Armenians on this network for over
six years. I have seen the likes of you enter his forum, make fools of
themselves, and "simply vanish" as did the Armenians in 1915!  

[KT] Hey , and dont give me that freedom of speach bullshit once more.

Realize sir, you are not in Turkey! In the USA freedom of speech is not
considered "bullshit". It is because of such freedoms that Turks like yourself
are allowed to attend Georgia Tech.

[KT] Because your freedom has ended when you started writing things about my 
[KT] people. And try to translate this "ebenin donu butti kafa David.".

What's the problem? If you can't stand the heat -- leave! Your government
murdered 1.5 million Armenians and you would have me stay quiet to suit your
personal fancy or some fascist fetish regarding the greatness of Turkey! Well, 
that is simply too bad. 

[KT] BYE, ANACIM HADE.

Pis bogaz!
