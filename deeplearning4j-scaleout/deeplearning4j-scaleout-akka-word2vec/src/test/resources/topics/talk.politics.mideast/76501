I took your advice and ordered a copy of the Washinton Report.  I
heartily recommend it to all pro-Israel types for the following 
reasons:

1.  It is an excellent absorber of excrement.  I use it to line
    the bottom of my parakeet's  cage.  A negative side effect is
    that my bird now has a somewhat warped view of the mideast.

2.  It makes a great April Fool's joke, i.e., give it to someone
    who knows nothing about the middle east and then say "April
    Fools".

Anyway, I plan to call them up every month just to keep getting
those free sample magazines (you know how cheap we Jews are).

BTW, when you call them, tell 'em barf sent you.

Just Kidding,

Ben.
