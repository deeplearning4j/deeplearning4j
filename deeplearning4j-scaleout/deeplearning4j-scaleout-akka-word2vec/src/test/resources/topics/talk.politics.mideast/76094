  Oh....I see...I didn't realize this...

  I think that perhaps you should print flyers on this topic, and your
  reasons for thinking the way you do. You should then distribute them
  amongst the world's population. You see, I don't think there are many
  people who are aware of this fact. Thank you for telling us the truth.

  BTW: I would start by sending your flyers to each of the UN officials.
	   Also, after you have distributed your flyers you might consider
       hiding. You see, I think that once more people read what you think
       they will have to lock you up in a mental institute; and don't think
       they will ever let you out.
 
  It is a strange strange world you live in. I feel sorry for you.
