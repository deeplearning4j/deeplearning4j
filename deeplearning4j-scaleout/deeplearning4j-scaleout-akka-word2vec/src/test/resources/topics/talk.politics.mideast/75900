An open letter to Marc Afifi


Dear Marc,
	I believe that you are wrong about Mr. Freeman.  He has written in
a style that raises the level of posts on this board.  If you just don't seem
to get it, I believe that it is more of a reflection of you and your abilities
than of him.  His posts contain substance and and he defends his positions 
well.
	Having said this, I would like to ask in general for people on this 
board to realize that if they don't agree with the substance of posts, then they should respond to the substance (or lack of) of the posts rather than attack
the author of the posts.  When one has to resort to attacking a poster rather than what he/she has written, one can see that that person does not have the
ability to make a coherent argument concerning the post.

Peace,


Danny
