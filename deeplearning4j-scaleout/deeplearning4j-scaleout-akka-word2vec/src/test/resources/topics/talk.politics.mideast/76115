Don't swallow propaganda as truth Sir. British promised to Venizelos
(greek PM) that mainly greek populated areas of the Ottomans will be
given to Greece, _if_ he will agree to drag Greece in the side of
the British during the WWI (because the greek King was proGerman).
The British succeeded by bombarding Athens (1916), killing quite a few,
forcing abdication of the King, division of Greece into two separate
states (North-South), and finally laying the ground for the most disasterous
division between greeks for our century.(So don't feel bitter that the
"Allies" gave any green light because they liked us....)

Anyway, the British succeed to establish Venizelos, war starts at a second
front against the Germans in the south while they were fighting the war
in the East against the Russians, and finally the WWII came in an end.
After that the British (and French) forgot immediately their promises
(as usually). Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek
cause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usual
"reasoning" and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they gradually
backup Kemal (who had given now to the British "water and bread" that
he will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small
ethnic-state). The main drive behind this British switch was the plan
to keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansion
into warm-water facilities. The "greek empire" being an Orthodox Christian
state was too prone to become Russian client.

Out of this intrigue, the current state of affairs was established on our
lands. While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true "Giants" by the
British, since they worked to realize their goals in the region.
Under the same plan, currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of big
military funds from the US; both they are functioning as anti-Russian
buffers, while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept. because
otherwise the use of terror of changing "the balance of power in the Aegean"
will be used.

Under the same exact rational you should see the Cyprus problem.

Gr

PS: I don't make any anti-...whatever rhetoric. This is the situation
    in our region and needs to be said. The previously mentioned powers
    are not anything special; they are fucntioning the same way which
    anyone else functions all throughout history. So I don't selectively
    single them out; just they are relevant to _our_ current afairs.
