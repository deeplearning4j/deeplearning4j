  You really belong to the 25-30% of ignorants in USA who don't know what
  the Holocaust ("Shoa" should be the real word) was. First you write in

   instead of Joseph GOEBBELS. And you dare to say that you
   "know more about Nazi Germany than most people (maybe including "us")" ? 
   I'm sure you learned the history of Nazi Germany AND Austria from
   your family.

  Trying to make comparisons between Israels politics and Nazi German-
  Austrian politics shows only your degree of ignorance (high), intellect
  (low), humanity (none) and antisemitism (average). I respect anybody
  who dissagrees with me as long as he respects me and discusses in a
  civilized manner. I would never say that anybody that critizises Israel
  and/or its politics is an antisemite, except he uses antisemitic
  vocabulary/terminology/demagogy. Israel is not a perfect country and
  its politicians also commits errors, even some of them are corrupt
  (like politicians in any other country), but they carry a huge burden:
  to care for the safety of ALL its citizens, and that is really not an
  easy task in a country that is surrounded by enemies who only expect
  that Israel commits the ONE BIG ERROR and wipe the country (and its
  Jewish citizens plus the so-called collaborators, arabs that wanted to
  live in peace with their Jewish neighbours) of the map. As I said,
  Israel is not a perfect country, but it is the ONLY democracy in the
  whole Middle-East and the only country in the world where Jews from
  everywhere can have a refuge in case of persecutions in the countries
  they are living.
  Our long history has taught us that we cannot rely on non-Jewish
  nations and its governments: as soon as there are more or les big
  social-economical-political problems in any country, the first ones
  that pay for the broken glasses are the Jews, and later the other
  minorities of the country.

  This is really outrageous: 6.000.000 murdered Jews, besides the
  thousands  who survived the Shoa in some way or another, and the rest
  of the living ones mourning for all of them ! I don't know what you
  call a "Civil Libertarian" (never heard about them) but I know only
  one thing: if all of them think like you do it, then "Civil Libertarians"
  is a new denomination for Antisemites. May other Civil Libertarians come
  to word to this group so that we can learn if A.Beyer and me are right
  (that Civil Libertarians are Antisemites), or that I'm wrong and he is
  missusing that word.
  BTW, I couldn't care less for what Andi Beyer appreciates.
