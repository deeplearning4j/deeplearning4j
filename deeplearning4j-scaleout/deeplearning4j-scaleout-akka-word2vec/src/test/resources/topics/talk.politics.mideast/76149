"fete"??? Since this word both formally and commonly refers to
positive/joyous events, your misuse of it here is rather unsettling.

I certainly abhor those Israeli policies and attitudes that are
abusive towards the Palestinians/Gazans. Given that, however, there 
*is no comparison* between the reality of the Warsaw Ghetto and in 
Gaza.

Just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying 
entity to maintain order, especially in the face of elements
that are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure. 
Ironically, international law recognizes each of these focusses
(that of the occupied and the occupier) even though they are 
inherently in conflict.

Israel certainly cannot, and should not, continue its present
policies towards Gazan residents. There is, however, a third 
alternative- the creation and implementation of a jewish "dhimmi"
system with Gazans/Palestinians as benignly "protected" citizens.
Would you find THAT as acceptable in that form as you do with
regard to Islam's policies towards its minorities?

It is a race, then? Between Israel's anti-Palestinian/Gazan
"Final Solution" and the Arab World's anti-Israel/jewish
"Final Solution". Do you favor one? neither?

Since there is justifiable worry by various parties that Israel
and Arab/Palestinian "final solution" intentions exist, isn't it
important that BOTH Israeli *and* Palestinian/Gazan "rights"
be secured?
