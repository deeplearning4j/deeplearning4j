You somehow missed Nabil's comments, even though you included it in
your followup:

I am not aware of "killings between Jewish tribes" in the desert.

The point of "typical thinking" here is that while Arabs STILL TODAY
act in the manner you describe, like "any nomadic people occupying a 
land", killing and plundering each other with regularity, others have
somehow progressed over time.  It is not surprising then that Arabs
often accuse others (infidels) of things that they are quite familiar
with: civil rights violations, religious discrimination, ethnic
cleansing, land theft, torture and murder.  It is precisely this 
mechanism at work that leads people to say that Jewish tribes were
killing each other in the desert, even without support for such a
ludicrous suggestion.
