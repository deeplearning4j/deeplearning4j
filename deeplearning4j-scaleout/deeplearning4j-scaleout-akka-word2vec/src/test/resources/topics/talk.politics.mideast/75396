Sounds like wishful guessing.

'So-called' ? What do you mean ? How would you see the peace process?

So you say palestineans do not negociate because of 'well-founded' predictions ?
How do you know that they are 'well founded' if you do not test them at the 
table ? 18 months did not prove anything, but it's always the other side at 
fault, right ?

Why ? I do not know why, but if, let's say, the Palestineans (some of them) want
ALL ISRAEL, and these are known not to be accepted terms by israelis.

Or, maybe they (palestinenans) are not yet ready for statehood ?

Or, maybe there is too much politics within the palestinean leadership, too many
fractions aso ?

I am not saying that one of these reasons is indeed the real one, but any of
these could make arabs stall the negotiations.

I like California oranges. And the feelings may get sharper at the table.
