Ahhh, of course. Israeli morality pales in the face of charming events 
like the string of PLO-run skyjackings in the mid 80's (remember those 
TWA jokes?), and not to forget the Achille Lauro and however many airline
bombings they have committed, not to mention bombings on the streets of 
Israel (It's gotten to a point where children are told not to go near any
bags or containers whose origins they don't know, because they could be 
bombs), or last weeks Katyusha rocket attack on Northern Israel by Fatah,
those wonderful "mainstream moderates" with whom Israel is attempting
to negotiate.

Let's not forget the fact that more Palestinians are killed by Palestinians
than by Israelis.  Ahh yes, those charming humanitarian death squads.
I've actually seen a videotape of an interrogation (DSee the documentary 
_Deadly Currents_--very neutral and balanced--seriously)--It was rather 
inquisition-esque. essentially, to prove his loyalty to "the cause" of
whichever group it was that was interogating him, he had to turn in someone
else, or else face death in one of the many fun-filled ways that the death-
squads love so much--beatings, dismemberment, acid, pouring melted plastic
on the face of the 'guilty party,' and of course beheading, always my 
favorite.  Did you catch the photos in the Washington Post a while back 
the execution of a "collaborator?"  3 photos:
1) one Palestinian leading another at gunpoint.
2) The "collaborator" on his knees, the gun pointed at his temple.
3) The executioner standing on the corpse of the "collaborator
shouting about how this is what happens to collaborators.

Wonderful justice system, and lots of regard for Human rights.
Remember Black September?
Ok, so they just tried to take over Jordan, big deal.

I'm rambling now, but are you getting what I'm saying?
