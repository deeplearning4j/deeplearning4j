Those damned, spiking Israelists, right, Barfling?

"Trained Seals"?  You mean the ones that flap their flippers making
"Arf, Arf!  Arf, Arf!" sounds?

In your own diseased mind, you now seem to believe that tax exemption
is equivalent to government funding.  Holy Shit, Batman!  The US
government is now one of the major supporters of the Catholic Church
--  in violation of the rules of separation of Church and State!

Or does your anti-logic only apply to the mosques belonging to what
you have described as "Ragheads" or perhaps the synagogues of those
