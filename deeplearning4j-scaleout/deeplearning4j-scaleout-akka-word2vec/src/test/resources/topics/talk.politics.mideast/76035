henrik]  Country. Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the
henrik]  KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan. 

BM] Gimme a break.  CAPITAL letters, or NOT, the above is pure nonsense.  It
BM] seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities
		     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Again, Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves. What do
     want them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.

BM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment,
BM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it
BM] is a part of it.  

Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged 
training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.
	
henrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 
henrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the 
henrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending 
henrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. 

BM]  Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them
BM]  within their borders?  

	Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into 
        the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.

henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the 
henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER 
henrik] OCCUR again.

BM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?

   It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped
   into Armenia if SHE could.
 
BM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header
BM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  

	Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many
        cases, HISTORY repeats itself. 

BM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes 
BM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring
BM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians 
BM] are attacking Azeri towns.

	So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey
        wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!

	I will believe it when I see it.

	Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing
        to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?
	Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the
	BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean
	BURNING people ALIVE !

BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the 
BM] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that 
BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's 
BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.  

	Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are 
        NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY 
	from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN. 

BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent 
BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe 
BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better 
BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?

	Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the
	conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in
	KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.

BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes
BM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of 
BM] their blood and future. 

	Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension
        to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH
        are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.

BM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize 
BM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians
BM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate 
BM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in
BM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for
BM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading
BM] inflammatory half-truths.

	It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative. I am absolutely
        for it. But, in the meantime, if you do not take care of yourself,
        you will be WIPED out. Such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of
	The Armenian Massacres.
