'SDPA.ORG' criminals/Nazis in action. Your fascist government got away with 
the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying 
the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away 
with the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in 
Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem 
districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed
and hundreds of civilians also perished.

   Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included 
   the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,
   Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives, 
   children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians 
   joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan 
   districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of
   3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished
   to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to
   the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and
   seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell
   into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims
   themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels
   also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the
   large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from
   occupying the city.

   The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out
   the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the
   neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They
   raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours'
   distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.

   At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,
   Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible
   atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in
   the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the
   neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.

   Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the
   Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four
   villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,
   they continued to spread death and destruction among the
   Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down
   their arms.

"In his speech given at the Sivas Congress, Mustafa Kemal once again drew
 a picture of the  country under occupation:

 In the East, the Armenians are making preparations for advancing to the
 River Halys (Kizilirmak), and have already started a policy of massacring
 the Moslem population."


pp. 966-967.

"The situation of the southern provinces of Turkey after the signing of the
 Mudros Armistice is described by Ataturk in his speech:

 The Armenians in the south, armed by foreign troops and encouraged by the
 protection they enjoyed, molested the Mohammedans of their district. They 
 pursued a relentless policy of murder and extinction everywhere. This was 
 responsible for the tragic incident at Maras....the Armenians had completely 
 destroyed an old Mohammedan town like Maras by their artillery and 
 machine-gun fire.

 They killed thousands of innocent and defenceless women and children. The
 Armenians were the instigators of the atrocities, which were unique in
 history.
