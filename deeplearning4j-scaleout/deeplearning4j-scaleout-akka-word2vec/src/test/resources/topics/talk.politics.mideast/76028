henrik]  My response to the "shooting down" of a Turkish airplane over the 
henrik]  Armenian air space was because of the IGNORANT posting of the 
henrik]  person from your Country. Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to 
henrik]  drag ARMENIA into the KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan. The 
henrik]  KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 
henrik]  years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are 
henrik]  the ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending 
henrik]  themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. Agression that has NO MERCY 
henrik]  for INOCENT people that are costantly SHELLED with MIG-23's and 
henrik]  othe Russian aircraft. 

henrik]  At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the 
henrik]  KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL 
henrik]  NEVER OCCUR again.

DA] Armenia is involved in fighting with Azarbaijan.  It is Armenian
DA] soldiers from mainland Armenia that are shelling towns in Azarbaijan.

    Well, this is your opinion ! 

    Turkish/ Azeris can BARK all they WANT since the ABOVE is UNTRUE. However, 
    I am sure YOU GUYS would have NEVER brought up ARMENIA's involvement if 
    KARABAKHI-Armenians had had HEAVY losses.


DA] You might wish to read more about whether or not it is Azeri aggression
DA] only in that region.  It seems to me that the Armenians are better
DA] organized, have more success militarily and shell Azeri towns
DA] repeatedly.  

	Read what ? The New York Times , that is publishing anti-armenian
	articles. Nop, I have my resources. Look, everyone knows how aggressive
        Turks/Azeris have been in the past. Armenians ARE NOT gona sit
	around and watch FIRE WORKS by AZERIS taught by TURKS. 

DA] It seems to me that the Armenians are better organized, have more success 
DA] militarily and shell Azeri towns repeatedly.  

	Buch of non-sence CRAP and you know it. Who the hell you think
        you are talking to ? Azeris are FIGHTING LOCAL ARMENIANS in 
	Nagarno-Karabakh. You tell me who has more MIG's ? Freedom fighters
        in Nagarno-Karabakh or Azerbaijan ?

	Again, I will say it for the last time, ARMENIA is NOT involved
        in this WAR and you guys WANT to bring this up in order to cover 
        up the Turkish involvment in the Karabakh. Go ahead , REPEAT as 
	much as you want. 

DA] I don't wish to get into the Cyprus discussion.  Turkey had the right to
DA] intervene, and it did.  Perhaps the intervention was not supposed to
DA] last for so long, but the constant refusal of the Greek governments both
DA] on the island and in Greece to deal with reality is also to be blamed
DA] for the ongoing standoff in the region.  

	Not a chance ! You CAN NOT convince me (based on your REASONS)that 
	your GOVERNMENT did the RIGHT thing to invade CYPRUS. 

DA] Lastly, why is there not a soc.culture.armenia?  I vote yes for it.
DA] After all, it is now free.  

	Well, I am NOT in the position to agree or disadree with you.
