Bullshit.  You've been in Iceland for the past 30 years.  You told us
so yourself.  It had something to do with not wanting to suffer the
fate of your mother, who has lived with Jews for a long time or
somesuch.  Sounded awful.

Are you as concerned about peace and justice in Palestine (Jordan)?

Let's say that Israel grants the PLO _EVERYTHING THEY EVER ASKED FOR_.
That Israel goes back to the 1967 borders.  What will the "Palestinean
Arabs" in Tel-Aviv call themselves?  The Palestineans in West
Jerusalem?  In Haifa?  Will they still claim to be "occupied"?

Or do you suggest that Israel expell or kill off any remaining Arabs,
much as the Arabs did to their Jews?

Indeed, there is much which is not symmetrical about the conflict in
the M.E.  And most of this lack of symmetry does NOT favor Israel.
