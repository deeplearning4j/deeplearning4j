	Finally you said what you dream about. Mediterranean???? That was new....
	The area will be "greater" after some years, like your "holocaust" numbers......

	Is't July in USA now????? Here in Sweden it's April and still cold.
	Or have you changed your calendar???

        Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons  <-----------i
        to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan		
        it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons	
        since it's content is announced to be weapons?   

	If there is one that's confused then that's you! We have the right (and we do)
	to give weapons to the Azeris, since Armenians started the fight in Azerbadjan!
 

|>You are correct, all Turkish planes should be simply shot down! Nice, slow
|>moving air transports!

	Shoot down with what? Armenian bread and butter? Or the arms and personel 
	of the Russian army?
