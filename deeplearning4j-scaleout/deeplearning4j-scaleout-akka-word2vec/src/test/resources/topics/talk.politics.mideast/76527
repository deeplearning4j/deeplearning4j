henrik]  The Armenians in Nagarno-Karabagh are simply DEFENDING their

henrik]  INVADING their homeland.


HE]     Homeland? First Nagarno-Karabagh was Armenians homeland today
HE]     Fizuli, Lacin and several villages (in Azerbadjan)
HE]     are their homeland. Can't you see the
HE]     the  "Great Armenia" dream in this? With facist methods like
HE]     killing, raping and bombing villages. The last move was the
HE]     blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees, trying to
HE]     escape the from Lacin, a city that was "given" to the Kurds
HE]     by the Armenians.

Nagorno-Karabakh is in Azerbaijan not Armenia. Armenians have lived in Nagorno-
Karabakh ever since there were Armenians. Armenians used to live in the areas
between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh and this area is being used to invade 
Nagorno- Karabakh. Armenians are defending themselves. If Azeris are dying
because of a policy of attacking Armenians, then something is wrong with this 
policy.

If I recall correctly, it was Stalin who caused all this problem with land
in the first place, not the Armenians.

henrik]  However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane
henrik]  to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one
henrik]  that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane
henrik]  (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA.

HE]     Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 U.S. Cargo planes
HE]     were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities
HE]     announced that they were going to search these cargo
HE]     planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany.
HE]     5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of
HE]     of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not
HE]     humanitarian aid.....

What story are you talking about? Planes from the U.S. have been sending
aid into Armenian for two years. I would not like to guess about what were in
the 3 planes in your story, I would like to find out.


HE]     Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about.
HE]     Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons
HE]     to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan
HE]     it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons
HE]     since it's content is announced to be weapons?

It's too bad you would want Turkey to start a war with Armenia.
