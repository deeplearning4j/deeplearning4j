Amir: 
Why would you categorize the sale of land as shafting? was
it because it was sold to Jews? was it fair to assume that the 
fallahin would be mistreated by the jews? is this the norm of 
any commerce (read shafting) between arabs and  jews? 

Your claim that the Lebanese/Syrian Landlords sold Palestine
(if true, even partially) omits the fact that the mandate
treaty put Lebanon and Syria under French rule, while
Palestine under british.  Obiviously, any such landlord
would have found himself a foreigner in Palestine and would
be motivated to sell, regardless of the price.

It is interesting though that you acknowledge that the
palestinians were shafted. Do many Israelis or Jews share
your opinion ?  Do you  absolve the purchaser from
any ethical commitments just because it wasn't written down? 

All told, I did not see an answer in your response. The
question was whether the intent behind the purchase was
aimed at controlling the public assets (land,
infra-structure etc...). IMHO the Palestinians have grounds
to contest the legality of the purchase, say in world court.
