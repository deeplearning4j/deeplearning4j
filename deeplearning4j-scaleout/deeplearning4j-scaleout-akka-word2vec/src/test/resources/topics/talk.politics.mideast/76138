The lengthy article you quote doesn't imply this.  It only states that
it is somehow POSSIBLE, not that it is in any way likely.  This is akin
to an article saying that it is POSSIBLE that the USAF has several
captured UFOs, without supporting the liklihood of such an assertion.

In other words, they were telling a pesky reporter to keep guessing.

Israel maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapons it may or
may not have.  The US maintains the same attitude about the presence
of nuclear weapons on specific naval craft.  By refusing to
acknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships, US
warships have, I believe, become unwelcome in New Zealand, which has
declared itself a nuclear-free-zone.

The USAF has never officially admitted to having any UFOs, either.

This is stated as a fact without supporting evidence.  It would've
been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name
of someone who is sitting in jail, lost to the world, as he suggests.
Maybe Elvis, or JFK, somebody.  

Let's put it this way: If Israel has put people away without
publicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them, how
has their disappearance been explained?  People have relatives,
friends and colleagues, you know.  Israel is not known as a place
where people are made to vanish.  Would you care to give us a list of
people whose whereabouts are unknown?  People who are presumed to be
imprisoned?  This whole conspiracy story isn't something that we've
come to associate with Yigal Arens before.  Perhaps from now on, we
should.
