  I'll start with a parable.
 
  A Christian woman hires a carpenter to build her a birdhouse.  When he comes
over, they begin talking about religion.  "So you believe that you understand
God?" he asks.  "Yes, I do," she replies.  "Then have him build you the 
birdhouse."

  I don't think that Melinda is complaining about the basis of Christian 
belief.  However, there is a tendency among Christians to say, "I have all the 
answers because God gave them to me."  This is simply not the case.
  I believe that the Bible is inerrant.  However, our HUMAN interpretations of
the Bible are necessarily in error, because we are human and imperfect.  We
have to remember that we ALL make mistakes in faith, and that because we are
human we have an imperfect understanding of the mind and will of God.  To
claim, as so many people do, that the existence of the Bible allows us to
determine the answers to all questions is to claim that we humans can fully
understand God's will.  This is hubris.
