That's a very weak argument--due the lack (with regard to critical
events) of independent supporting texts.

As for the dating of the oldest extant texts of the NT....  How would
you feel about the US Civil War in a couple of thousand years if the
only extant text was written about *now*?  Now adjust for a largely
illiterate population, and one in which every copy of a manuscript is
done by hand....
