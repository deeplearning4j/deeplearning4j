I have no doubt that God hears everybody's prayers.
However, He does things His way, i.e. things will happen
only if it is His will.

Now if the question really is "Does God grant everybody's wishes ?"
then you'll get a brutal shot of reality similar to when you didn't
get that toy you wanted for Christmas. You just cannot expect
to get everything you want in this world.
