[Several people were involved in trying to figure out who first used
the phrase "God-shaped hole".  --clh]

"There is a God shaped vacuum in all of us" (or something to that effect) is
generally attributed to Blaise Pascal.
What I want to know is how can you have a God shaped vacuum inside of you if
God is in fact infinite (or omnipresent)?
