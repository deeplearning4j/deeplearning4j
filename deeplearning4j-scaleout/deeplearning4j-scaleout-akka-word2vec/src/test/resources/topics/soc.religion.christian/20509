A question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a
philosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything
evil done in its name?  You're missing a central teaching of Christianity -
man is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing
that, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all
who consider themselves "christians" are (even those who manage to head
their own "churches").  "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will
enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who
is in heaven." - Matt. 7:21.

Again, what historical documents do you trust?  Do you think Hannibal
crossed the Alps?  How do you know?  How do you know for sure?  What
historical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis-
credit it as well as the Bible has?

Well, it's really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you
into believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving
you further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:
1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain
it.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this
salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain
modern offshoots like the "new age movement" teach or does he require God's
help?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such
help come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for
some people it did comprise their life's writings, so I am hardly in a
position to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few,
of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me).
The spritual life is a difficult journey (if you've never read "A Pilgrim's
Progress," I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).

Now I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a
conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You
wrote that "I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most
of the teachings of christ".  Well, Christ referred to God as "My Father",
not "My Mother", and while the "maleness" of God is not the same as the
maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not
honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,
or politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent
to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - 
english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God
chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human
population.

Well, I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of
the role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the
last 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this
article.  I just happened across yours and felt moved to reply.  I hope I
may have given you, and anyone else who finds himself in a similar frame of
mind, something to contemplate.
