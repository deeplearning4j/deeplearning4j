 excellent question timothy. i hpoe the answers you get will be satisfactory  
as we can not understand the mind of god. but to attempt to answer you  
clearly. GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he  
intends to judge mankind. the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus  
Christ is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to  
serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god,  
the bible calls this sin. for those who die before the end of the world/have  
already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche.
  God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world. however  
there is no plus and minus system for GOD. he has declared that he can not  
tolerate spiritual imperfection, thus he can only based your worthiness to  
live with him on the wrong in your life. 
  Good people, yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD, The  
Christian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sin's  
penalty. the proscribed punishment for sin is death, just as the proscribed  
punishment for robbery is time in jail. God then cannot ask for anything but  
punishement for those sins. He does not want to condem. the Bible says in John  
3:17, that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that  
through him it might be saved." when i realize that i have sinned, and i do  
with painful regularity, i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin  
against me, i have that right and privlige only because of Christ. as for Jews  
they are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come, and  
dis come in Jesus of Nazereth. Muslims, i fear have been given a lie from the  
fater of lies, Satan. They need Christ as do us all.
  for those who don't have that right, in the view of the bible they stand  
olone in their defense. are you going to hell? i can not answer that for you.  
i can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to  
Hell? that step is much more rewarding.

my opinions are my own, you may borrow them

p.s. stay in touch and keep asking questions not just to us but to God as  
well, he listens too.
