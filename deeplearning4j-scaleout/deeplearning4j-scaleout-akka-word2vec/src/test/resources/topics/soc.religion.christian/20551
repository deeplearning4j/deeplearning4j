  I question the implications of this statement; namely, that there are certain
physical acts which are limited to God and that attempting to replicate these
acts is blasphemy against God.  God caused a bush to burn without being
consumed--if I do the same thing, am I usurping God's role?  
  Religious people are threatened by science because it has been systematically
removing the physical "proofs" of God's existence.  As time goes on we have to
rely more and more on faith and the spiritual world to relate to God becuase
science is removing our props.  I don't think this is a bad thing.
