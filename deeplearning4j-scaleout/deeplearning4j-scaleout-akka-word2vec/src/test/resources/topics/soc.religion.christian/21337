Oh yea?  Which version of the Bible is the perfectly preserved one?  And
why are there so many translations that are not perfectly preserved?  Is
God trying to confuse us?

But that is exactly what happend.  There are so many branches of 
denominations of Christianity and deviations of doctrine portruding
from varying translations of biblical texts by "serious students" that
are much too numerous to begin to count.  If there is a Perfect Bible,
then there would be no possible misinterpretation and there would be
no need for anyone here to be debating it.  On the other hand, maybe
the Bible is perfect, but no one on this planet is perfect enough to
read it correctly, but then there would be no point in God giving us
something we cannot use correctly.

IMHO, if you trust your salvation on the reliability of a single book,
you are on weak ground.  Remember, In the beginning was the Word, and
the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  This Word existed BEFORE
the Bible was written.  (Note: Word <==> God).  This Word that John is
trying to describe cannot be fully described in any written language,
all languages being IMPERFECT.  Realization comes only from contemplation
of the Word, and is outside the boundaries of language.  I use the Bible
as a guide, a stepping stone, but in no way is it my final authority.
God alone is the final authority.
