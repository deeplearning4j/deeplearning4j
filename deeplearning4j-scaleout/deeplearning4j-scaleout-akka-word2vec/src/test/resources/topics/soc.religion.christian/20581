I am extremely uncomfortable with this way of phrasing it.  God's love 
is unconditional, unqualified, unfathomable.  We are capable of 
rejecting God's love but He never fails to love us.

These verses do not show that God's love is qualified but rather that He 
is opposed to evil.

I am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be 
an innappropriate emphasis on Hell.  God deserves our love and worship 
because of who He is.  I do not like the idea of frightening people into 
accepting Christ.  

I see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows God's love with 
putting into words and explaining that love.  Preaching the Gospel 
without living the Gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a 
clanging cymbal.

Here's a question:  How many of you are Christians because you are 
afraid of going to Hell?  How many are responding to God's love?
