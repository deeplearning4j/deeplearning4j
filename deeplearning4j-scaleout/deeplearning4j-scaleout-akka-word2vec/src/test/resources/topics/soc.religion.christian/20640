That is not necessarily unorthodox.  When Christians call God 'Father', 
we are using a metaphor.  The Bible in one place refers to God as being
like a mother.  God is neither a father nor a mother in the literal
sense; God has some of the attributes of both; the father metaphor is
usually used because (for most people at most times) it is the less
misleading of the two possibilities.
