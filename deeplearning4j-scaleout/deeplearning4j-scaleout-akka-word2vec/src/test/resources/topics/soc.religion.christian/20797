just picked out this one point because it struck me....
why do you believe this?  muslims believe in many of the same things
that christians and jews believe; they believe jesus, while not the
messiah, is a prophet.  this seems to me to be much closer to
christianity than other religions are.  (then again i tend to be
somewhat liberal about others' beliefs.)

this also relates to the serbian "ethnic cleansing" question.  i have
been waiting for condemnations of this and have seen very few.  HOW
can we stand by and watch innocent people, even people whose beliefs
we condemn, if this is the case (and don't get me wrong, the things
fundamenalist muslims have to say about women make my blood boil), be
tortured, raped (the stories about that made me physically ill), and
killed?  jesus loves all, not just those who love him back -- and he
would advocate kindness toward them (in the hopes of converting them,
if that's the way you want to put it) rather than killing them.  

i'm sorry i got off the subject here -- maybe i should have used a
different title.  i did need to get this off my chest, however.

peace (shalom),
vera shanti

[I am also worried about this issue.  I've made a posting under my own
name earlier today.  I do not much want to discuss Moslem beliefs
here.  This isn't the right group for it.  Their beliefs about Jesus
appear to come as much from the Koran as the Bible.  This means that
while they honor him, what they think he did and stood for differs in
many ways from Christian beliefs about him.  But Moslem beliefs are
an appropriate topic for soc.religion.islam.

As I'm sure you know, many Christians believe that you must accept
Christ in order to be saved.  While Stanley's comment appears to be
anti-Moslem, I would assume he would say the same thing about all
religions other than Christianity.
