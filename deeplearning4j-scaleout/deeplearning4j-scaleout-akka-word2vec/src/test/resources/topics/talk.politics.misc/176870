Yes, it was Nixon who was most vocal about giving money to Russia.  It
makes me proud to be a libertarian.  It appears both conservatives and
liberals prefer to cold war until you win, then nurse the enemy back to
health for another go around.

It's like subsidizing the wealthy countries (Japan, Germany, etc.) with
free defense, and then trade-warring with them because of the economic
competition.  It's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying
bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke.

I ask myself, what law could we pass to prevent government from doing
stupid, frivilous things with OUR money?  Then I think, the Constitution
was supposed to do that.  Could someone please tell me what legitimate
constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money
from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries?  Seriously.
