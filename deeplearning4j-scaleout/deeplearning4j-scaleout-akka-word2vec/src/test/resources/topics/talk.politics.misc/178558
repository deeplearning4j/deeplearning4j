Here's my own top ten response to Mr. Ipser's list


10.  It's about time we have a President that might actually stand up to the
     military.  Our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not
     revolve around them, and that one of the things they're out there defending
     is our right to be critical of them, even denounce them.

9.   Let me explain something to you.  Environmental policy and industrial
     policy MUST go hand in hand.  Our nation, and indeed, our planet cannot
     afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years.
     Our industrial/environmental position has been downright SHAMEFUL! We
     must have active government support of the key industries such as,
     telecommunications, microelectronics, medical, biotech, and environmental
     tech.  Meanwhile weed out old, inneficient, high-polution, industries
     that are better left to other nations.  This will make us richer, help
     produce new jobs, and help the environment.  To give credit where credit
     is due, I heard a lot of this in a speech by Senator John Kerry (D-MA)
     tonite.  In addition, it's time we get really, really serious about 
     issues like overpopulation, globabl warming, and ozone depletion.  The
     planet on which we live should be our utmost priority!

8.   It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work,
     to provide the services that people need, and to help solve the problems
     that need to be solved.  Granted, some things can probably be done more
     efficiently for less money, and should be.  But some things are going to
     cost more money and I'm sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about
     taxes all the time.  You want to live in my country, you pay your fair
     share!

7.   I can't believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give
     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes.  If you're
     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an
     enemy which at best doesn't affect us and at worst really should be our
     friend, then you have no right to tell me you shouldn't pay taxes!

6.   Hey, I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60's-esque touch!

5.   Look, Canada, Europe, and Japan manage to provide health care for their
     citizens (and, yes, basic health IS a human right which people are
     entitled to).  If these nations aren't capitalist enough for you, then
     I guess we've found something better than capitalism!  There is nothing
     sacred about the capitalist system, and if something, be it socialism
     or anything else, works better, then I say let capitalism die.

4.   Make love, not War!

3.   Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to be a male and a feminist
     at the same time.  To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity
     to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong, and trying to force
     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse.  Women certainly 
     have as much to offer this world as men, and the day that gender
     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of
     the past few centuries seem like reform bills.  I look forward to it.

2.   See number 10.

1.   HEY MAN, ACADAMIA RULES!!
