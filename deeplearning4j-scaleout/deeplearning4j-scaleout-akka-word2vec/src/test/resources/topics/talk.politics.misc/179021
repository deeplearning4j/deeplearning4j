[In response to a report by CBN News correspondent Ken Lormond about a
meeting between Slick Willie and homosexual activists:]

Lormond: "But Clinton will not be attending a rally by homosexuals in
Washington later this month.  He will instead be out of town, on a
retreat with Senate Democrats."

Robertson: "Yeah, he'd better retreat."  [Laughter, followed by
sustained applause]

[Later, in a report by correspondent Deborah Whitsen on the fizzling
boycott instigated by homosexuals against Colorado:]

Whitsen: "Colorado ski resorts have seen record crowds this year
despite a call by homosexual activists for boycott of the state ...
There have been record snowfalls in the mountains this year, and the
skiers have been coming in droves ..."

Robertson: "And God said, let it snow ..."  [More sustained applause]
