Probably because more people have access to alchohol.  It IS LEGAL you know.

Of course, this kid would be much better off selling crack to his neighborhood

And if those drugs were legal, the neighborhood could legally go to hell.

So you are saying crack babies who are that way legally are okay?

You can't even walk down the street at night alone in America because of drugs.
