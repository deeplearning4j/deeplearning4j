I want people to be able to get the things they need in life.  Property
ownership may not be ideal, but it is far better at letting people get
what they need to live a productive, fulfulling life.

The first experiment in America, where property ownership was denied,
caused, starvation, hunger, and death.  Few people know that the
Pilgrims originally tried to have common property to grow food and a
common food store.  Many people know the hardships they suffered the
first few winters because of it.  After arriving, the Pilgrims made all
property common.  They all shared in the work and the resulting crops
went into a common store.  After much debate the new Governor Bradford
privitized the land; assigning plots to each family.  According to Perry
D. Westbrook:  "The change was immediately justified by the increased
industry of the inhabitants and by the larger acreage planted."

Bradford himself acknowledged this failure of communism.  He wrote:  "The
experience that was had in this common course and condition, tried
sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the
vanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some of
later times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community into
a commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiser
than God.  For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed much
confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been
to their benefit and comfort."

Bradford did not blame this failure on the "strangers", but on the basic
selfishness in all men.  He wrote "seeing all men have this corruption in
them, God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them."  In other
words, according to Westbrook, "Bradford found private enterprise to be
the most suitable economic policy for mankind in its fallen state."

Let's not make the same mistake that the Pilgrims made.  Private
property allows a society to flourish, the alternative brings
starvation, poverty and discontent.
