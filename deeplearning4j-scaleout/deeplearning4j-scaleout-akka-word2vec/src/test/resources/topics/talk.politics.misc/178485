      Well, it seems the "National Sales Tax" has gotten its very
      own CNN news LOGO!

      Cool.  That means we'll be seeing it often.

      Man, I sure am GLAD that I quit working ( or taking this 
      seriously ) in 1990.  If I kept busting my ass, watching 
      time go by, being frustrated, I'd be pretty DAMN MAD by 
      now.
      
      YEAH!  Free HEALTH CARE!   Oh, yeeaaaahhhh!

      heh heh

      MORE AMAZING PREDICTIONS FROM THE INCREDIBLE BROMEISTER!
      --------------------------------------------------------

      We take you back to Feburary 20th, when the INCREDIBLE 
      BROMEISTER PREDICTED:

	  " $1,000 per middle class taxpayer in NEW TAXES "

          " A NATIONAL SALES TAX "

      Now, for more AAMMMAAAAZZZZZZIINNNNGGGGG Predictions!

      i)   The NST will be raised from 3% to 5% by 1996.
	   Ooops.  They ALREADY DID it.
          
	   Okay, then.  The NST will be raised from 5% to 7% by 1996.

      ii)  Unemployment will rise!

      iii)  Tax revenues will decline.  Deficit will increase!
	    We'll get another DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE by 1997!
	    Everyone will DANCE AND SING!

      Yup.  I'm gonna <glancing at watch> bail out of here
      at 1 PM, amble on down to the lake.  Hang out.  Sit
      in the sun and take it EASY!   :)   Yeah!  

      I just wish I had the e-mail address of total gumby who
      was saying that " Clinton didn't propose a NST ".

      To paraphrase Hilary Clinton - " I will not raise taxes on
      the middle class to pay for my programs "

      To paraphrase Bill Clinton - " I will not raise taxes on
      the middle class to pay for my programs "
