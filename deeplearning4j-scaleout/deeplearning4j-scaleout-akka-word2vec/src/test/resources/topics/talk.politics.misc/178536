Not at all.  I am not a member of the Religious Left, Right, or even
Center.  In fact I don't consider myself very religious at all [ this will
probably result in flames now :) ].  In fact Phil, you should leave
religion out of it.  It just clouds the issue.

How typical.  So you think we shouldn't avoid these 'events' [ I shall
refrain from the word disaster since it seems to upset you so much.  :( ]
when we can.  In case you didn't realize it, the natural disasters [ oops,
sorry events ] you are refering to  we have no control over.  Man-made
ones we do.

I guess you missed the show on Ch 20 earlier this week about the disaster
[ oops there I go again... I meant to say event ] on the Exxon Valdez.
Just a natural every day occurance to spread oil on 300 Miles of beach. I
would like to know which natural event [ hey I remembered not to say disaster ]
that would be similar to this.

Hmm, I suppose you could be right.  They are as natural as a tree, or a
sunrise.  NOT !

So look, if you want to worship a oil slick ( or toxic waste dump or live
in a house that has a cesspool in the front yard ), fine, you have my
permission to do so [ yea right like you need MY permission... ], it just
won't be in the neighborhood where I live.  But DON'T try to push your
shortsighted tunnelvision views off on the rest of us.
