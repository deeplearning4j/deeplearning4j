In my lifetime, your philosophy -- socialism masquerading as a liberal
welfare state -- has been in ascendancy.

Absolutely.  So the response of socialists is take us even further
into socialism.

To the extent that people have been encouraged to NOT be responsible
for themselves, yes.

# # # # Come on.  You and I both know that the major problem of this society

# # # Hey, she's too proud to go on public assistance, but the only jobs

Sonoma County.

# You live in a strange and wondrous place, sir.  Inexpensive housing,

Not exactly cheap, but not Los Angeles, either.

No, it's that areas with a lot of wealthy breed socialists -- all the
spoiled rich kids, feeling guilty about their wealth.  But not guilty
enough to give it away -- they just look for politicians to take MY
more limited wealth away.

# # # I see a lot of people willing--nay, eager--to work.  What I don't see

# # # welfare, which nobody enjoys, but there just aren't the jobs any more.
# # # When the US was expanding industrial capacity there was always a mill

Yup.

# # # Mr. Cramer, I was there:  Hippiedom was a very low-budget operation.
# # # Our drugs were cheap.
# 
# # The money I was referring to was Aid to Families with Druggie 
# # Cohabitators (AFDC).
# 
# Well, I doubt that much of this goes to drugs--there isn't much left after

I can tell you that relatives I have known, the drugs came first, the
food was secondary.
