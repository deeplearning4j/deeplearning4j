It is obvious that Mr. Cramer has the 'ability' to take the 'leap of faith'.
I have listened to several of the men involved in this study, and even they
claim that the men involved will not 'tell the whole truth'.

I put little value in extrapolating from these types of 'studies' or 'surveys',
they have limited subsets of individuals, and there is alot of skewing due
to improper selection methods, and the bias of the people involved in the
studies on both sides- subject and researcher.

Would you admit to be part of a group that was not very well liked?  Would 
you admit to having had sex with other people at some considered abnormal
rate (this applies to heterosexual men).  In fact, as one gay man and one
straight man put it, "men lie about the number of partners, because that's
the thing to do"- our culture for the male almost requires this type of
response.  It may seem harmless and silly, but carries a large emotional
and mental price tag.

I hear college male students everyday talking about their 'supposed' 
conquest.  They just have to look good to one another, at least in their
eyes.  But also know that alot of this does go on, there are many college
males (hetero) having a lot of sex with different partners.
