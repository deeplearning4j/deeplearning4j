Not true. I am required to have insurance by law. the method of collection
effectively makes it a tax.

Well here we have the right hoping for more selfish bastards. Pity they
don't look at what 12 years of the Regan/Bush "selfish Bastard" ecconomy
has done to the country.

Elect a selfish bastard government and they will run the country for themselves,
thats why they are selfish bastards. Bush and Regan gave tax breaks for the
ultra rich and paid for them by borrowing against the incomes of the middle
class.
