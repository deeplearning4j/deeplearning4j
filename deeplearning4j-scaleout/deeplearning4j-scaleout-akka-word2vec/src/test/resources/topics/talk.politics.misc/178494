      HAHAHAHAHAH.  Oh, CHRIST!  Oh, HAHAHAHAH.

      whew.  Mark, what on EARTH makes you think I give a FUCK
      about being a "success", particularly NOW when I'll just
      the HELL taxed out of me?  Oh, this is excellent.

      Holy christ! :)

        Besides, let's <ahem> examine the record, shall we?

    Broward:   " Clinton's going to taxe the HOLY FUCK out of you! "
    Mark:      " No, he's not.  Only $17 / month "

   ( I STILL get a laugh out of this one! :) )

    Broward:  " Oh, here comes a National Sales Tax "
    Clinton Supporter:  " Oh, no, Bill never said that "


    Want some more "free predictions" ?

       Yup.  They surely did.
       Almost as pathetic as Clinton suppoters are looking in
      April of 93. 

     Well, chumbo, I see my my watch here that my "appointment"
     at the lake is about 2 hours past due! :)

     You'll let me know who the "full-time" working thing works
     out, won't you?   I want to enjoy EVERY minute of my free
     time and FREE health care ( the ONLY reason I would have 
     gone back to working! :)  THANKS, BILL! :) )
