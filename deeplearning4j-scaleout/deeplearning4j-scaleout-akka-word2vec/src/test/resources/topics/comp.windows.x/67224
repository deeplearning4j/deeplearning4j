We are in the process of evaluating X-terminals. This includes running XRemote
over a serial line.
I would like to run some X benchmarks to determine comparative performance.
Has anyone written any such benchmarks, or know of any useful programs on the
net ? I heard of a program called "Xstone", but I couldn't locate it using
archie.

Please reply to afielden@mlsma.att.com, as I don't get to read this newsgroup
much.
Thanks in advance for any help.
