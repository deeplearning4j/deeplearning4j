Hi,

  Please reply to me direct as I am not a member of this list.

  I am new to X, so please excuse my lax (read: "probably incorrect")
terminology!

  Environment: Sun Sparc 10, SunOs 4.1.3.  X11R5 path level 23.  My X process
is started by xdm.

  i) I want to setup the backgroud (root window?) of the tvtwm display to
     display the escherknot etc (grey is a very boring colour to work on)!

     The setup is as follows:

        lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0    -   xsetroot -bitmap ... etc
        ~user/.xsession         -   xsetroot .... etc
                                    tvtwm

     There are also .tvtwmrc and .Xdefaults files in the (~user) home
     directory.

     The xsetroot in Xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm
     login window as expected - very nice!

     Unfortunately, when the users session is started, the background of the
     tvtwm window reverts to grey.  If I manually type xsetroot... in an
     xterm window when the session has started, the background is changed as
     expected.

     The question is: How do I retain the background from the login window
     and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the
     the users session startup?

 ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised
     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.

     ie: real key       key shown on screen
         ------------   -------------------
         hash           back slash
         tilde          pipe
         double quote   at symbol
         pound          hash
         cursor key     not recognised

     This is very annoying!  Is X at fault here or the machine setup?  I have
     installed the xterm drivers that came with X11R5 in both terminfo and
     termcap as they seemed more uptodate.

     Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as
     expected!

  Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!

  Thanks,

Dave.
