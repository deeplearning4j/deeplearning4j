Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into
emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to
change the source code so that all of these special keys generated
character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier
state as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence "ESC [ 1 B 7" 
would indicate that the "HOME" key was pressed, with the shift key
down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such
as "shift-Return".

If anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll
have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with
it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code
in the source file "x11term.c".  Maybe if someone at OSF is 
interested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got
bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about 
emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods 
somewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.

Notes: 

 * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create
   its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which 
   includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.

 * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2
   [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].  The patches are
   in a chunk of code between '#if sun ... #endif' but could 
   easily be adapted for anything else.
