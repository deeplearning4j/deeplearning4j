Hi,
I have a problem when compiled Wcl 2.02 in SCO ODT 2.0:


        cc -c -Ox  -I.. -I/usr/include Xt4GetResL.c
Xt4GetResL.c
Xt4GetResL.c(47) : error C2065: '_XtConstraintBit' : undefined
*** Error code 1

Although I follow the instructions in file README_BUILD to build Wcl in SCO 
platform, this problem didn't resolve.

So I have some questions related to this matter:

  1. Does _XtConstraintBit exist in SCO ODT 2.0? ( Does _XtConstraintBit use
      in X11R3 & X11R4? And What release does SCO ODT 2.0 use, X11R3 or X11R4?)
  2. If not, Does someone know how to work around?
