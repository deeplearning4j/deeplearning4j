 We've developed a number of applications using DevGuide and found it to 
be a very useful tool. I've been impressed with the level of integration it
affords using the connection editor. I love the general ease of use.
 
 I talked with Tali Aben at Sun today about DevGuide + Motif. She was very
helpful. We provided some input as to what we'd like to see in the next
version of DevGuide. Tali was very enthusiatic about our comments. I mentioned
I was going to post this email message and she offered to receive additional
comments from the net on what DevGuide should evolve into.

 Pretty cool example of a company that cares what we want.... More of this
and computers may have a future.

 Frankly, I like the idea that it will offer some migration capability
to DOE/DOMF through an integrated ToolTalk capability, pointed out in March's 
SunExpert magazine. 

 Technology works, we can crankout the interfaces with DevGuide. Price is 
outstanding.
