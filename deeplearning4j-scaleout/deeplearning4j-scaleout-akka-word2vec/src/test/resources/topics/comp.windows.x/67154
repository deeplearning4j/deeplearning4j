	Doug> I've built X11R5 with no problem before .. but now its all  headaches.
	Doug> For example, the xset client complains that libXmu doesnt have a bunch

	Doug> build of libXmu DOES link in libXt  so I am really perplexed  what  is

	Doug> ....following up on this, the specific error I get is:
	Doug> Could not load program ./xset 
	Doug> Symbol XtVaSetValues in ../.././lib/Xmu/libXmu.a is undefined

....  a  search  on  IBMLINK  revealed that this is similar to IX33890
(howervre this was closed USE).
