Forgive me if this is a FAQ (I have checked the list but I cant find it).

I have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO (not grayscale monitors)
The problem is that when I have an character application that displays input
fields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the
input field.

The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather
than a block, but how do you do this. I can't find any means although
various sources seem to indicate it can be done.

When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block.
This would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the
default either.

Configuration is  : Motorola 88K X11R4

Please reply by email if poss.

Thank you
