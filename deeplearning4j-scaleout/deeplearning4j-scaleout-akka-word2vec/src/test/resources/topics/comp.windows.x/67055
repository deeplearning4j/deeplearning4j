I have been trying to compile some source code for a mpeg animation viewer for
X Windows. I got the code from a ftp site. I have modified the Makefile as
they instructed, no errors there. What happens is that I get the following
message when everything is going to be linked:

make: fatal error.

Does anyone know where these missing functions are located? If you do can you
help me with it?

I posted before to one of the other Unix groups, I tried their suggestions but
always get this error.

If you have to know: I am using Unix system V. The machines here are 486's. The
terminals I want to use are separate and just called X-terminals and they seem
dedicated to that. I'm not sure as to what they really are, since it is one of
my first times out with this X-windows gidget! That is, first time programming
for it, so to speak. I use them alot just for the graphics things.

If you can help, mail me soon.

Gerard.
