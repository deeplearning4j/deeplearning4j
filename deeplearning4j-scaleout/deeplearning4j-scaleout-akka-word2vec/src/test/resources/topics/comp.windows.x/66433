Subject:  58)! Where can I get patches to X11R5?

	The release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced
in the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.

	Patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other
sites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the 
newsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in 
their source distributions of X11.

	People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has 
23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line
		send fixes #
where # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.

	Here are a few complications:
	1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request "5a", "5b", "5c" and 
"5d" separately
	2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was 
re-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris]
	3) fix 8 is in two parts: "8a" and "8b"
	4) fix 13 is in three parts: "13a", "13b", and "13c"
	5) fix 16 is in two parts: "16a" and "16b"
	6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which 
previously was optional
	7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff
by asking for "PEXlib.uu.[1234]".
	8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, "22a" through "22i"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?

	The xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail 
it a request, and it mails back the response.
	Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The
xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can 
have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). 
The xstuff server treats the "Subject:" header line just like any other line 
of the message.
	The archives are organized into a series of directories and 
subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an 
index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the 
subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.

	1) The command "help" or "send help" causes the server to send you a 
more detailed version of this help file.
	2) if your message contains a line whose first word is "index", then 
the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If
there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then 
the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. 
For example, you can say "send index fixes" (or "index fixes"). A message that 
requests an index cannot request data.
	3) if your message contains a line whose first word is "send", then the
xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name 
an item, you give its directory and its name. For example
                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9
	You may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many 
safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large 
amounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed
amount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the 
day's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. 
Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out 
shortest-first.
	4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting 
return addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If 
you happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like
        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu
or
        path bar!foo!frotz
in the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.

	The xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If 
your mailer deals in "!" notation, try sending to 
{someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.

Subject:  61)  Where can I get OSF/Motif?
	
	You can obtain either OSF/Motif source or binaries from a number of 
vendors. 
	Motif 1.2.2 source is now available; it is based on X11R5.
	Motif 1.1 is based on the R4.18 Intrinsics and is currently [7/92] at 
1.1.5.
	An OSF/Motif source license must be obtained from OSF before source can
be obtained from the Open Software Foundation or any value-added vendor for
any version. Call the Direct Channels Desk at OSF at 617-621-7300 for ordering 
information.
	Various hardware vendors produce developer's toolkits of binaries, 
header files, and documentation; check your hardware vendor, particularly if
that vendor is an OSF member. 
	In addition, independent binary vendors produce Motif toolkits for
machines for which Motif is not supported by a vendor; the kits include varied 
levels of bug-fixing and support for shared libraries and are based on widely
divergent version of Motif:
	Quest (408-988-8880) sells kits for Suns, as well; 
	IXI (+44 223 462 131) offers kits for Sun3 and Sun4. 
	NSL (+33 (1) 43 36 77 50; requests@nsl.fr) offers kits for the Sun 3 
and Sun 4.
	Bluestone Consulting makes a kit for Sun systems.
	ICS (617-62-0060) makes several binary kits, notably for Sun, DEC.
	HP and DEC have announced support for Motif on Sun systems.
	Unipalm (+44-954-211-797) currently offers for Sun systems a Motif 
Development Kit including X11R4 and based on Motif 1.1.2. The US distributor is
Expert Object Corp (708-926-8500).
	BIM ships Motif 1.1 binaries for Suns. Shared library support is 
included. Contact Alain Vermeiren (av@sunbim.be) or Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be) 
at +32(2)759.59.25 (Fax : +32(2)759.47.95) (Belgium).
	SILOGIC (+33 61.57.95.95) ships Motif 1.2 and Motif 1.1 on Sun 
machines.
	S.I. Systems offers Motif 1.2 for Solaris 2.1; info: 1-800-755-8649 in
USA and Canada.
	Metro Link Inc. (305-970-7353, sales@metrolink.com; in Europe contact
ADNT, (33 1) 3956 5333, UniVision (UK) Ltd. (44) 628 82 22 81) ships an 
implementation of X11R4 and Motif 1.1.2 (including a shared-library 
implementation of libXm.a) for the 386/486 Unix market.  Motif 1.1.2 is 
also available for Sun Sparc based workstations. It has also announced 
Motif 1.2 for Solaris systems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  62)  Does Motif work with X11R4? X11R5?

	Motif 1.2 is based on X11R5.
	Motif 1.1, available in source form from OSF as of August 1990, uses 
the "vanilla" X11R4 Intrinsics, where "vanilla" means "with just a few 
patches"; the file fix-osf which OSF distributes is obsoleted by MIT's patches 
15-17.  The file fix-osf-1.1.1 distributed with the 1.1.1 version or its 
subsequent modification needs to be applied after MIT fix-18, though.

	Motif 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 will work with X11R5 if X11R5 is compiled with
-DMOTIFBC; 1.1.4 and later should work with the vanilla R5, although there are 
some known new geometry-management problems.
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  63)  Where can I get toolkits implementing OPEN LOOK?

	Sun's XView has a SunView-style API. A version is on the X11R4 tape;
the latest [2/92] 3.0 sources are on export in contrib/xview3/.
	XView and X binaries for the Sun 386i ("roadrunner") are available for 
ftp from svin01.win.tue.nl (131.155.70.70), directory pub/X11R4_386i.
	Supported binaries of XView 2.0 or 3.0 include: 

XView for non-Sun Platforms  (domestic and selected international vendors).
Several are also available from Sun; contact your local sales office.

	AT&T's OPEN LOOK GUI 3.0 Xt-based toolkit is now generally available 
[2/92]; contact 1-800-828-UNIX#544 for information. Binaries are produced
for SPARC systems by International Quest Corporation (408-988-8289). A version
of the toolkit is also produced under the name OLIT by Sun. 
	More recent versions of OLIT have been ported to IBM 6000 and DEC MIPS 
by both UniPress and ICS. OLIT is also available for HP from Melillo Consulting
(908-873-0075). MJM (Somerset, NJ) makes OLIT 4.0 for HP 7xx series running
HPUX 8.0, DECstations, and RS/6000s [thanks to Joanne Newbauer, 
jo@attunix.att.com, 908-522-6677.]

	Sun is shipping OpenWindows 3.0; contact your local sales 
representative for more details; the package includes toolkit binaries and 
header files.

	ParcPlace's (formerly Solbourne's) extensible C++-based Object 
Interface Library, which supports run-time selection between Open Look or 
Motif, is available from 303-678-4626. [5/92]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  64)! Where can I get other X sources? (including R5 modifications)

	The MIT Software Center ships the X Test Suite on tape.

	A multi-threaded version of Xlib based on X11R5 patch 12 is now 
available for anonymous FTP from (new version 1/93):
        DEC on gatekeeper.dec.com (16.1.0.2) in /pub/X11/contrib/mt-xlib-1.1
        MIT on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) in /contrib/mt-xlib-1.1

	HP has made available drivers to permit the building of the X11R5
sample server on the HP 9000 Series 700 workstations; the files are on
export.lcs.mit.edu in ~ftp/contrib/R5.HP.SRV. [8/92]

	User-contributed software is distributed through the newsgroup
comp.sources.x, moderated by Chris Olson (chris@imd.sterling.com); also check 
that group for posting information.

	Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has been creating a list of freely-
available X sources.  The list is stored on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib as
x-source-list.Z. It lists the main storage locations for the program and 
international sites from which it may be ftp'ed.

	The machine export.lcs.mit.edu has a great deal of user-contributed
software in the contrib/ directory; a good deal of it is present in current or 
earlier versions on the X11R3, X11R4, and X11R5 contrib tapes. There are also
directories for fixes to contrib software.  The file on export in
contrib/00-index.txt is a quick overall index of the software in that area,
provided by Daniel Lewart (d-lewart@uiuc.edu).

	These sites used to and may still mirror export and are of particular 
use for Australasia: Anonymous ftp: ftp.Adelaide.EDU.AU; ACSnet Fetchfile: 
sirius.ua.oz.

	The material on giza.cis.ohio-state.edu, which tends to duplicate 
the export archives, is also available via anonymous UUCP from osu-cis, at TB+ 
and V.32 speeds.  Write to uucp@cis.ohio-state.edu (same as osu-cis!uucp) for 
instructions. [the archive is now maintained by Karl Kleinpaste]

	A new west-coast UUCP X11 Archive is administered by Mark Snitily 
(mark@zok.uucp) and contains the full X11 distribution, the XTEST
distribution, an entire archive of comp.sources.x and other goodies.
	The machine zok has a TB+ modem which will connect to 19.2K, 2400, 
1200 baud (in that order).  The anonymous UUCP account is UXarch with password 
Xgoodies.  The modem's phone number is 408-996-8285.
	A sample Systems (or L.sys) entry might be:
   		zok Any ACU 19200 4089968285 in:--in: UXarch word: Xgoodies
	To get a current listing of the files that are available, download
the file "/usrX/ls-lR.Z".
	A full subject index of the comp.sources.x files is available in the
file "/usrX/comp.sources.x/INDEX".
	The machine has just the one modem, so please do not fetch large 
amounts of data at one sitting.
[courtesy Mark Snitily, 2/90]

In addition, UUNET Source Archives (703-876-5050) tracks comp.sources.x and 
provides 800MB+ of compressed programs on 6250 bpi tapes or 1/4" tapes.  It 
also mirrors export/contrib in its packages/X directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  67)  What widget is appropriate to use as a drawing canvas?

	Some widget sets have a widget particularly for this purpose -- a
WorkSpace or DrawingArea which doesn't display anything but lets your Xt 
application know when it has been re-exposed, resized, and when it has received
user key and mouse input. 
	The best thing to do for other widget sets -- including the Athena set 
-- is to create or obtain such a widget; this is preferable to drawing into a 
core widget and grabbing events with XtAddEventHandler(), which loses a number 
of benefits of Xt and encapsulation of the functionality .  
	At least one version has been posted to comp.sources.x (name???). 
	The publicly-available programs xball and xpic include other versions. 
	The Athena Widget manual (mit/doc/Xaw/Template in the R5 distribution) 
includes a tutorial and source code to a simple widget which is suitable for 
use.

Subject:  75)  Where can I get an "X terminal" server for my low-end Sun 3/50?

	Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu) has written Xkernel; the current
version [1.4 as of 8/91, 2.0 expected RSN] is on sol.ctr.columbia.edu 
[128.59.64.40] in /pub/Xkernel.gamma. It turns a Sun 3/50 into a pseudo- X 
terminal; most of the overhead of the operating system is side-stepped, so it 
is fairly fast and needs little disk space.
	A similar approach is to run the regular X server by making /etc/init
a shell script which does the minimal setup and then invokes Xsun, like this
example script from mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.EDU:

#! /bin/sh
exec >/dev/console 2>&1
/etc/fsck -p /dev/nd0
case $? in
 	0)	;;
 	4)	/etc/reboot -q -n
 		;;
