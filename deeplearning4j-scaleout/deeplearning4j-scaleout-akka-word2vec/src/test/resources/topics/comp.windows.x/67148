A question like this is answered in the FAQ, about sharing X windows.
One of the answers is XTrap, a record and playback extenstion to X.  You
can find it at export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/XTrapV33_X11R5.tar.Z.

Does anyone know of a program which doesn't require an X extension?  Most
the the X servers we have at work have vendor extensions which we can't
modify, so XTrap doesn't help up.  There is X conferencing software at
mit, but I don't know how easy it would be to modify it to do record and
playback.

Any help would be appreciated.
