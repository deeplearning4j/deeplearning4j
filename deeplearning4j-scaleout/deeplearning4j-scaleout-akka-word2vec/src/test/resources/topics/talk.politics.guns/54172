Steve,
     It's nice that you find me laughable but I don't quite
understand.  Is it because you think my firearms clash with
what I'm wearing, or that my NRA sticker isn't on straight?
Please state your judgement! 
     I find it sad that people won't accept the responsibility
to defend themselves.  And I laugh with the same contempt you
have for me at the sheep who expect the government to protect
them.

You and your friends sound like a bunch of smug intellectuals.

Oh,   I guess you are.  I'm still waiting for you all-knowing
academic-likes to solve the worlds problems.  Let us know when
you have the answers or punch lines as this case may be.

So it's not a "Yankee" thing?
Are Canadians actually as uncivilized as we Americans?

Well if it's anything like here it wouldn't matter if they
did; they wouldn't be able to use them.

You shouldn't waste your time watching TV, Steve. It will corrupt
your mind.

Ditto to you, Self Righteous One.
Lay your derogatory tirade on thick, Steve.  Y'all can keep laughing and
I'll keep feeling safe and secure.
