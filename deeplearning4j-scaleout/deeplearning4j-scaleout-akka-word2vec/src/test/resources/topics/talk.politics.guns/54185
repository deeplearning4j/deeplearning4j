So what.  We think you're pretty hilarious too.

I love how you Brit's kiss royal arse.  That you're willing to throw
out freedom-of-speech for the sake of protecting the reputation of the
royal sluts.

That the British government advertised in American newspapers "Send A Gun
to Defend a British Home -- British civilians, faced with threat of
invasion, desperately need arms for the defense of their homes." during
WWII.  [American Rifleman November, 1940]

That The Obscene Publications Act and the Misuse of Drugs Act have been
used as justification for the police to seize masterpieces such as William
S. Burrough's "Junky", Hunter Thompson's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas",
and Tom Wolfe's "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test".  British courts have
never recognized the right to assemble or to demonstrate.

That evidence obtained form coerced confessions is allowed in a trial.

That only serious felonies warrant a trial by jury.

That suspected terrorists must prove their innocence, instead of the
government having to prove their guilt.

That the secretary of state may issue an "exclusionary order" which
bars someone from ever entering a particular part of the United Kingdom,
such as Northern Ireland or Wales.

That the BBC banned Paul McCartney's "Give Ireland Back to the Irish"
as well as John Lennon's "Give Peace a Chance" during the Gulf War.

Yes, England is very very funny.  And very pathetic.

So what.  Laughter is a way of dealing with things we find uncomfortable.
I thought the "Las Vegas Show Girl" ads on Las Vegas street corners were
pretty funny.

Yes indeed, there are many strange and wonderous things in this country.
I wouldn't have it any other way.

I don't disagree with that, I don't think it's bad either.

So what.  If they didn't come from here they would come from elsewhere
disguised as cocaine.

>Anyway, all you gun nut Rush Limbaugh fans, please *keep* up your diatribes
>against Brady and other  evil "Liberal media" plots  - you 're so damn funny!
>You provide endless amounts of entertainment in your arguments and examples

You can laugh all you want, for us it's a matter of life or death.
I don't find that funny in the least.

As for England:

"As our allies become more open, Britain grow yet more secretive and
censorious.  Perhaps the real British vice is passivity, a willingness
to tolerate constraints which others would find unbearble." [in "Britain,
An Unfree Country" by Terrence DeQuesne and Edward Goodman, pp 33.]
