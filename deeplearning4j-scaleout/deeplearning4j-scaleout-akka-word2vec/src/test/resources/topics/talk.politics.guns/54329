	Waco is a city of about 100,000 people.  The population temporarily
   raised to about 102,000 people when all the feds, and state police officers
   arrived.

	I tell you what, I stayed in a hotel room about 4 miles from the BD
   compound around 3 weeks ago.  I have never felt more paranoid in my whole
   life.  There were at least 100 state police in the hotel.
