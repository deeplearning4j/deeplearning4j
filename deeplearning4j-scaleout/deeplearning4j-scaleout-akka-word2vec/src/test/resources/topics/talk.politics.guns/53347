	Here! Here!  But any call for responsibility and accountability 
	from police is invariably interpreted as being "soft on crime".
	Being "tough on crime" and building more prisons and seizing more
	property is the politically astute thing to do these days.

	Don't forget the politicians that write the laws that make it
	easy for the police agencies to become corrupt.  The War on Some
	Drugs brought us this corruption and only an end to it (legalization)
	will stop the corruption.
