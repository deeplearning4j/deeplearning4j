You can't spell. There is no question about it.

We must be reading different public opinion polls. I agree that the
misguided public would like to see assault weapons banned (mainly because
they are being lied to by the media about the frequency of their use
in violent crime ... ~1%), but if public opinion were so dead-set
against the RKBA you can bet that idiots like Metzenbaum and Schumer
would be seeing their foolish bills getting passed through Congress
a LOT easier than they are. And as governments go broke and can no
longer protect their citizens you can bet that the American people
will start to really appreciate the usefulness of firearms. Contrary 
to what you might think, time is probably on OUR side, not YOURS.

Yeah, right. Don't hold your breath. My condolences on the discovery
of uncomfortable resilience in your mammary glands, but this has nothing
to do with the issue at hand.

Yeah, the liberal press doesn't like us much, but you can't really
expect coherent thought from them anyway. Their opinions are based
more on a desire to appear politically correct than on facts (which
are generously provided by the FBI, if they'd bother to put on their
Birkenstocks and go to the library to read them). Most of my friends
are anti-gun, and without exception NONE of them bases his/her opinions
on facts. They would rather believe (despite all evidence to the
contrary) that disarming law-abiding citizens would make the world
more civilized, when all it really does is make us all sheep. They 
would rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how
society has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. They 
support spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum
who have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society
or its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun
control (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little gun
control (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison. But they
have to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront
the fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that
are causing most of the trouble in society. Oh no, we certainly can't
accept that! But I guess I have faith that when crime starts making
significant inroads into their neighborhoods and starts directly
hurting them and their families, they will probably whistle a different
tune. They just better hope it isn't too late then.

Hmmm. I wasn't expecting company tonight. I might be able to whip
up a quick cheese and cracker plate, but they should probably bring
their own drinks. Do I have time to vacuum the rug?

I'm glad you ended the posting here. Your medication seems to have
worn off ...
