OHIO HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE   THURSDAY, APRIL 8, 1993
 
H.B. NO. 287- REPRESENTATIVES SEESE, DAVIS, BATCHELDER, AMSTUTZ, T. 
JOHNSON, VAN VYVEN, WACHTMANN, WHITE, DI DONATO, BOGGS, LOGAN
 
        TO AMEND SECTION 1531.01 OF THE REVISED CODE TO ADD MOURNING DOVE 
TO THE GAME BIRD LIST AND PERMIT THE CHIEF OF THE DIVISION OF WILDLIFE IN 
THE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES TO REGULATE THE HUNTING OF MOURNING 
DOVES, AND TO MAKE AN APPROPRIATION.
 
This would allow the hunting of mourning doves in Ohio and give the 
sportsman something they have been pushing for.
