I watched it live, and have re-watched it several times, and from the press  
vantage point, there was only one starting point visible, where the tank  
punched in on the windward side, and the winds whipped that fire across the  
whole, dry, wooden, structure in minutes.  Faned by the 30 mph gusts, and the  
Hueys.   If there were other fires started, they were not visible, nor were  
they needed to cause the flame progression I observed.
