       That's nice.  We strive for entertainment value.  :-)

       In the first place, you have to realize the feeling goes both
ways.  Canadians laugh at the U.S., and Americans simply shrug and
woner why the hell we let them be a State in the first place.  ;-)

       Interesting strategy, posting here with complaints about
people elsewhere.

        Courtesy is apparently a dead commodity in the rest of the
civilized world.  "Gun nut morons," indeed.

        We've got guns, they've got a monarch and an economy on the verg
of collapse.  Finger pointing across the Atlanticis a waste or time.

       Canada has been blaming the U.S. for their problems for years.
The simple fact of the matter is this:  Ten years ago they crowed about
how great their system was because they'd gotten rid of the guns and
the U.S. would be so much better if they'd just get into the divine light
shining from the North.  We pointed out that it was cultural differences,
and pointed to their pre-control crime rates.  We also pointed out that
the history of the entire world contained smuggling, and that whenever
something was wanted, it was smuggled in.
       If the problem were based on U.S. guns, it would have surfaced
years before.

       Now more Canadian criminals want guns.  And they are being provided.
Canada has its own version of the drug problem.  Yet drugs are prohibited
in the U.S.

       Saw a news report out of Britain that armed crime is on the rise,
and several police agencies are considering have permanent "firearms
officers" to deal with it.

       According to U.S. News & World Report, British handgun deaths have
risen over 250% over the past twelve years.  The U.S. number has dropped
5%.

       Maybe they're smuggling them across the U.S./U.K. border.  Yeah,
that's the ticket.

>CYA!

       Have a nice day, Steve.  Learn a little common courtesy and
politeness.
