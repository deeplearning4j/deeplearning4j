The FBI and Koresh were calling the shots.  And there were very sane reasons  
for keeping the children, if they let them go, the parents would NEVER see them  
again.  That is not an easy choice, in spite of you cold attitude about it.

I am a constitution worshiper.  You quite obviously eat anything the  
authorities feed you, without doubt, which makes you no different that a Koresh  
worshiper

If you do not believe this, you are truly naive.  It is not only possible, it  
is easy.  I worked in the broadcast profession, at a network station, in the  
late 70s, I know what I'm saying here.  Embarrasing footage is easy to get, add  
a little sinister music, and the right voice-over, and I'll have you mother  
agreeing to commit you.

The news shows were looking for excerpts which backed their position.  Do you  
think they would show excerpts which disproved their points?

The reports of multi-starts came solely from the FBI.  Anyone observing the  
fire from the available video would be hard pressed to see more than one point  
of fire.  Which spread across the compound as a uniform rate.

No reported has ever sued the government for such a situation.  They know the  
dangers.  Remember, the BATF invited the initial coverage. And how about a  
simple, remote-controlled, camera or two?  There were ways to provide media  
access.  The FBI obviously just didn't want any.

I can find several.  Tear gas and smoke making it impossible to remove the  
barricades.  Flames blocking exits to the saferooms. Perhaps the gun shots were  
from the FBI, keeping them pinned in?  Who knows?
