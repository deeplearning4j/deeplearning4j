|QUESTION:
|What will Californians do with all those guns after the Reginald
|denny trial?

The Wall Street Journal had an article on how the police were whining
about all the new guns; excuse me, but police are EMPLOYEES of the
government. Rather like having your janitor complain about job
conditions.

I say Californians should form armed block clubs that would engage
in coordinated strategies should BATF attempt to disarm them based
on the "nefarious tipster" theory of law enforcement. Unlike Waco, 
Californians should be able to destroy armored vehicles in city
streets with incendiary weapons, acetylene after slowing them down
with abandoned car blockades. M-1 Garands should easily outclass
BATF shock troops with their H&K MP-5 SMGs, and there should be
enough Sony Walkmans and Boom Boxes to overwhelm any FBI psy-war
operation... yes, a good time would be had by all. Billary Clinton
would get what he wanted, a War on Gunowners, the BATF would attempt
to show the anti-gun press they they really, REALLY were in charge
with a 500-man "Charge of the Light Brigade," and the FBI would attempt 
to show how _THEY_ really were in charge by asking the Californian 
National Guard to level the area with artillary!
