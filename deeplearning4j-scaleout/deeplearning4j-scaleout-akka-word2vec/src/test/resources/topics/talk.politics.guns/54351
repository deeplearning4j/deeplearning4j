Hmmm... I hadn't heard about rockets. ATF must be escalating their
tall tails... anyway

Why should they have "done something"? The Davidians had not attacked
or even threatened anyone.

>What possible use would a religious cult have for a rocket launcher?

It is not yours nor the governments right to tell others what they have
a legitimate right to own.

>Also, is child abuse covered by the Bill of Rights?

Is child abuse now within the jurisdiction of the department of the
treasury? Attacking citizens without due process on the strength of
unsubstantiated rumors about a violation of a law which does not
fall under your jurisdiction is a pretty serious breech of rights.
