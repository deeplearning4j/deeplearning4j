Ah, that British sense of humor.  Probably got a real gut-buster going
when the IRA blew that kid up a couple of weeks ago, huh?  Of course,
in Britain, your government has ordered you defenseless, so your way
of coping with violent criminals is to laugh at victims.

I don't know about a .45.  My own preference is for 9mm.

Ah, Canada.  Where the criminals don't bother with checking to see
if the victims are home.  They just break on in.  America's a little
different, you see.  Criminals worry a bit more about getting shot,
so they more frequently check to see if anyone's home.

I've heard Gun World in Phoenix, Arizona, is fantastic!  I'm hoping
to visit there myself soon.

Ah, Britain again.  Isn't that the place where you're guilty until
proven innocent?  Tell me, Mr. "jaj@vax.oxford.ac.uk" didn't Britain
come begging to us "gun nut morons" in the early 1940s for guns to
defend yourselves against Hitler?  Seems as though your supposedly 
enlightened government had disarmed you: "Aw chaps, you can jolly
give up your guns.  If that Hitler man starts to threaten, we can 
always hit up the Yanks for a few guns.  They've got a bloody
eccentric habit about those guns, you know.  Just hand in your
shotgun, that's it.  Thank you."

Ain't it just amazing how those black markets work?  Damn if those
drugs from south america keep coming over our borders, too, even
though we've banned them.  Guess we might as well legalize them.  
Makes you want to send fifty bucks to the Libertarian Party just
thinking about it, doesn't it?

Your close-minded ignorance is without parallel.  I guess that's what
happens when you're raised as a "subject" without rights.  Your
type gravitates to those who desire to hold power over you.

Just chuckle as the cops beat you senseless to get a confession.
Just laugh yourself silly when you find that confession is valid
in court.  "Hey mate, this is justice, British style."
