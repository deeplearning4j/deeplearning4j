"Widely reported", eh?  Remember, this has had a news blackout since day 2.
The FBI is the single, sole, source of these rumors.  It may be the truth, but  
it may not be.  We may never know.  We MUST question it, though.  Why no media  
coverare?  What were they hiding?

I feel strongly they were NOT proper.

As expected.  If it had come out well, he would not have hesitated to take full  
credit.
