	SeAL Team six should have handled it?  Delta Force?  The
BATF had more than enough equipment and men.  They did not have
good intel, but they did have poor planning.  They fucked up.  Even
in just the most basic military sense, they fucked up.  Excuses do
not justify body counts.

	And your excuses fall upon deaf ears when the same BATF
has shown shitty leadership despite more people, better weapons,
and exclusive use of armor against their targets.  BATF is nothing
more than a private army of the government.  Do the agents swear an
oath, as I did, to uphold the Constitution?  You know, that document
that stipulates the highest law of the land?  If they do, they should
be up for charges in a court of law.  Remember, the law?  That's
the whole reason for any of this.

	Yeah, I've been related to many of them.  This is flame-bait,
right?  I'm not paying your price.  Mind if I sight in my guns on
your body?  Think of it as the price you have to pay that we may all
live without fear of my making a stray shot.  It's fine and dandy to
revel in the other guy being the target and your supposed safety.  In
the military, we called this "chicken shit."  Leadership from the rear.
The War on Drugs, despite being a catchy term for nothing more than
a continuation of policy since before this century, seems to have
gotten you convinced that my rights aren't worth your good vibes.
Mind if I cut your net access, as well as access to any and all forms
of expression?  See, you make me nervous, what with you being able
to influence so many.  I'm sure you can see how this is the price we
have to pay for freedom and liberty in this country, as well as
a fair and unbiased judiciary.

	Mind if we include you in the body count?  I'm sure we could
all file it under "civic improvement" and your life wouldn't have
been sacrificed in vain.  If you like, you can will your estate to
defecit reduction, too.  Now, when you learn how the law protects, or
doesn't protect, everybody equally and how our collective boot may
one day be on your collective throat, perhaps at that time you will
mature enough to realize just what you're talking about and how
serious this is.

	Next time, include a smiley.  While I hesitate to think that
you could have meant this seriously, it deserved a small flame anyway.
