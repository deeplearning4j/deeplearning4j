Not to mention last year's Weaver affair.

Anyway, here's how I see the Waco affair; I'd be interested in other peoples'
interpretations...

1. Koresh and his people were basically minding their own business.
2. Some weapons violations may have been committed and I wouldn't have
   disapproved of prosecuting him for those violations.  However, I think
   the BATF was criminal for starting negotiations with a military style
   assault and for firing into a house where there were children and other
   noncombatants.
3. I don't see they couldn't just leave a token guard on the place and wait
   the BDs out; I don't approve of the tear gas approach and, if it caused
   the fire to be started, I think the FBI agent responsible should spend
   10-20 years in jail.
4. However, if Koresh's response to the tear gas was to kill everyone there,
   I hold him largely responsible for their deaths.
