Flame on!!

Is this guy serious????

If he would ever really pay attention to the news (oops I forgot that the media
   for the most part loves to jump right on top of a story before all the facts 
   are known, as well as to manipulate what we see and thus what we believe). 
   Any ways one of Koresh's DEVOTED followers that DID I REPEAT DID survive this
   "GENOCIDAL MASS-SLAUGHTER OF INNOCENT PEOPLE".  Besides there are nine 
   survivors in the burn-unit of the local hospital and was reported that David
   was in one of the towers when the shit hit the fan.  Besides, a majority of 
   these children were children that he was supposed to have been the father of,
   this then makes them bastard children to a sacraligious zeloit (sp).  Also
   someone should have told David and his followers that if they can't the heat
   then they should stay out of the kitchen!! (pun intended)

Flame off

" Aaah Daniaalson yah wanna fight,  fight me!!"
