All very true.  I'm going on what I have read and heard from friends.
Basically the Glock is great but I have heard/read that it is a lot harder to
learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has.  I was
looking at a Glock .40S&W and the S&W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the
safties on the guns were very different.  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot
more "safe"  (for lack of a better word) than the one on the Glock.  Of course
this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  You
would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.  Personally I
like the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool
(guess that's why they use them in so many movies) but I wouldn't get one as
my first semi-auto because of the safety.  I would prefer more training with
a "traditional" semi-auto (ala Colt .45) but of course that's just my opinion.
