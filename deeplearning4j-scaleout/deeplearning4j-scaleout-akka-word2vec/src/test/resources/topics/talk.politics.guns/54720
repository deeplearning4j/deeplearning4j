 I'm writting letters to my Congresscritters and was wondering if
 there is any reason(s) why I should NOT support the following
 Bills, other than the previous comments about S.458.  Just checking
 before I mail the letter to make sure I don't support something
 that I really shouldn't.

 -----------------
 I strongly SUPPORT the following laws currently being considered in Congress
 as they would either have a positive effect towards reducing crime, or re-
 enforce our Constitutional right under the 2nd amendment.

 * S. 441 (Campbell)	To amend title 18, United States Code, to provide a
			mandatory minimum sentence for the unlawful possession
			of a firearm by a convicted felon, a fugitive from
			justice, a person who is addicted to, or an unlawful
			user of, a controlled substance, or a transferor or
			receiver of a stolen firearm, to increase the general
			penalty for violation of Federal firearms laws,
			and to increase the enhanced penalties provided for the 
			possession of a firearm in connection with a crime of 
			violence or drug trafficking crime, and for other
			purposes.

 * S.458  (Smith) 	To restore the second Amendment Rights of all Americans.

 * S.488  (Specter)	To provide Federal penalties for drive-by shootings.

 * S.504  (Kohl)	To amend section 924 of title 18, United States Code to
			make it a Federal crime to steal a firearm or explosives
			in interstate or foreign commerce.

 Here's a story, bout a man named Brady, who took a .22 bullet
 in his head.  Even though he can act perfectly normal, he
 prefers to pretend he's brain dead.

 Here's a story, bout a woman named Brady, who had nothing to
 do but sit around all day.  Then her husband became a media
 martyr, now she wants to take all your guns away.

 The Brady Bunch, The Brady Bunch, This is how we got stuck
 with the Brady Bunch. . . . .
