Subject: Newspapers censoring gun advertisements
Lines: 88

Recently while looking around in Traders Sporting Goods store, a very well
stocked firearms store, I discovered a printed document that was being 
distributed by the good folks who work there.  Traders, BTW, is located in
San Leandro, CA.

Granted, the document may be asking you and I to help out Traders, but in the
big scope of things, I feel that we would do all gun owners a favor by helping
to this cause.

Anyway, here it is:

NEWSPAPER AD CENSORSHIP

Are you letting the newspapers tell you how to live your life, what's good for
you, what's not, and exercise blatant censorship over what you read in their
advertisments?

The newspapers have now decided to censor gun ads - which is why you no longer
see the ads that Traders, San Leandro, has run for many years.

These ads were run for the law-abiding honest citizens who own firearms for
sporting use or self-protection.  They certainly have the right to do so, under
the Second Amendment Right to Bear Arms.

If you are tired of newspapers who run sex and liquor ads galor, yet refuse to
run legitimate gun ads, please send a letter to the editors indicating your
displeasure over their censorship doctrine.

Following is a list of Bay area newspapers who censor gun ads.  Perhaps you'd
like to send them your thoughts on this issue!

Oakland Tribune		Daily Review		Alameda Times-Star
POB 28883		POB 5050		1516 Oak St.
Oakland, CA 94604	Hayward,94540	Alameda, CA 94501

Argus			Tri Valley Herald	San Leandro Times
3850 Decoto Rd.		POB 10367		161 W. Juana Ave.
Fremont, CA 94555	Pleasanton, CA 94588	San Leandro, CA 94577

Contra Costa Times	San Mateo Times		San Francisco Chronicle
POB 5088		POB 5400		901 Mission St.
Walnut Creek, CA 94596	San Mateo, CA 94402	San Francisco, CA 94103

San Fran. Independent	San Fran. Examiner	San Jose Mercury News
1201 Evans Ave		110 5th St.		750 Ridder Park Dr.
San Fran., CA 94124	San Fran., CA 94103	San Jose, CA 95190

Then there are six pages of "facts".  I can not validate these facts, and 
there were no sources, but many feel and sound very true.  Here are the topic
headlines:

- Big Media Snow Job
- Blaming Firearms for Murder is Like Blaming Hospitals for Death
- I could use the same Nazi Journalistic Technique of CBS and ABC to prove
  that Hospitals Cause Death
- How NBC, CBS, and ABC have scammed the American people on "gun control"
- American TV journalism is based on Nazi journalism
- Why TV journalists lie
- The Government with the help of the TV networks, has succeeded in playing
  one group against the other
- Gun laws are unconstitutional
- American gun laws are based on Nazi gun laws
- The Government is trying to devide and conquer
- The CIA wants your firearms

and so on for six pages.

So now we have the media trying help put gun dealers out of business by trying
to limit their exposure to potential customers, and preventing the customers
from reading about sales of ammunition and firearms for sporting, hunting, or
other recreational use.

Let me know if you write to any of these bozos.
