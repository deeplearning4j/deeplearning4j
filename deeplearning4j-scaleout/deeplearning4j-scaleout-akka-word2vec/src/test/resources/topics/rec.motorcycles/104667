 Anyone, 

    I am a serious motorcycle enthusiast without a motorcycle, and to
put it bluntly, it sucks.  I really would like some advice on what would
be a good starter bike for me.  I do know one thing however, I need to
make my first bike a good one, because buying a second any time soon is
out of the question.  I am specifically interested in racing bikes, (CBR
600 F2, GSX-R 750).  I know that this may sound kind of crazy
considering that I've never had a bike before, but I am responsible, a
fast learner, and in love.  Please give me any advice that you think
would help me in my search, including places to look or even specific
bikes that you want to sell me.

    Thanks  :-)
