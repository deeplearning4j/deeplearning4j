Sure.  I've never been much of a racerboy, as anybody who's attended the
Minibike Spectacular can attest.  ;^)  I get a great deal of satisfaction
in riding fast, yet now so fast as to be overly concerned about not being
able to maintain a clean line.  And while I'm still known to slide the
occasional tire, I much prefer to stay just to the sticky side of that
line.  I've found that I don't heal as well as I used to in days of yore.

BTW, how's the knee?

Quite true.  Another plus for a 500+ bike, the original thread, I think.
Damn circular threads...  ;^)
