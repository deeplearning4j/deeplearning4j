I think that the Vincent is the wrong sort of bike for Satan to ride.
Honda have just brought out the CB1000 (look in BIKE Magazine) which
looks so evil that Satan would not hesitate to ride it.  17-hole DMs,
Levi 501s and a black bomber jacket.  I'm not sure about the helmet,
oh, I know, one of those Darth Vader ones.  There you go.  Satan.
Anybody seen him lately?  Just a cruisin'?

God would ride a Vincent White Lightning with rightous injection.
He'd wear a one-piece leather suit with matching boots, helmet and gloves.
