I don't want to do this, but I need money for school.  This is
a very snappy bike.  It needs a little work and I don't have the
money for it.  Some details:

	~19000 miles
	Mitsubishi turbo
	not asthetically beautiful, but very fast!
	One of the few factory turboed bikes... not a kit!
	Must see and ride to appreciate how fun this bike is!

I am asking $700 or best offer.  The bike can be seen in
Bennington, Vermont.  E-mail for more info!

Thanks,
Chris
