>I eagerly await comment.

The ice princess next door makes a habit of flooring her cage out of the 
driveway when she sees me coming. Probably only hits 25mph, or so. (I made 
the mistake of waving to a neighbor. She has some sort of grudge, now.)

I was riding downhill at ~60mph on a local backroad when a brown dobie came 
flashing through the brush at well over 30mph, on an intercept course with 
my front wheel. The dog had started out at the top of the hill when it heard 
me and still had a lead when it hit the road. The dog was approaching from 
my left, and was running full tilt to get to my bike on the other side of 
the road before I went by. Rover was looking back at me to calculate the 
final trajectory. Too bad it didn't notice the car approaching at 50+mph 
from the other direction.

I got a closeup view of the our poor canine friend's noggin careening off 
the front bumper, smacking the asphalt, and getting runover by the front 
tire. It managed a pretty good yelp, just before impact. (peripheral 
imminent doom?) I guess the driver didn't see me or they probably would have 
swerved into my lane. The squeegeed pup actually got up and headed back 
home, but I haven't seen it since. 

Sniff. 

Sometimes Fate sees you and smiles.
