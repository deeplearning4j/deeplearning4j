This is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two
new newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing
the one originally posted in January '93 (and never taken to a vote).  The
proposed groups are described below:

NAME: 	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup
STATUS:  Unmoderated.
PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about
	 system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.

NAME:	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc
STATUS:	 Unmoderated.
PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,
	 including issues such as security, networking features, console
	 mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.

RATIONALE:
	Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family
	of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish
	to argue about the meaning of an "OS").  The family ranges from
	Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to
	Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over
	50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the
	actual release is slated for May/June '93.

	While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares
	an application programming interface with the other members of the
	Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-
	dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking
	and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for
	Windows 3.1.

	The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows
	3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses
	Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-
	sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced
	Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and
	NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.

	Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following
	groups with the other members of the Windows family:
		comp.os.ms-windows.apps
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32
	
	The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as
	well as Windows 3.1:
		comp.os.ms-windows.announce
		comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy
	
	In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the
	Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal
	structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating
	systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have
	undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate
	newsgroup hierarchies.

	Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --
	when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-
	generation Windows, "Chicago", debuts next year, surely it should
	remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-
	tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?


DISCUSSION PERIOD:
	The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  

VOTING:
	The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on
	the feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will
	be accepted prior to the CFV.
