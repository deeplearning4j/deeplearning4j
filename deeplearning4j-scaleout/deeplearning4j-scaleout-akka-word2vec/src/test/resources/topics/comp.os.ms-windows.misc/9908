You're using drivers version 2.02 or earlier. The latest is 2.03, available
from their BBS or by snailmail. It at least fixes the WfW problem.

The reason I wanted to reply in public instead of private mail is because
of following: I talked to their tech support a few days ago and was told
that I can expect a new version near the end of the month. Which should be
about now...

However, I have a problem when switching back from a DOS session in standard
mode. Apparently they don't know of this problem and seem to be surprised
why anybody would want to use standard mode at all.


It's a great card for the price, at least when I bought it. Now there may be
better alternatives.
