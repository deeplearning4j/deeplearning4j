This is a common problem with highly complex TrueType fonts.  Microsoft
admits to a problem with older versions of the PostScript printer driver,
but I've found it to be pretty generic.

You can get around the problem by adjusting the parameter OutlineThreshold
in the [TrueType] section of WIN.INI.  This entry specifies the number of
pels-per-em at which Windows will render TrueType fonts as outline fonts
instead of as bitmap fonts.  The default is 256.  I've generally been able
to get fonts to work by setting OutlineThreshold=160.  Depending on your
printer resolution and the point size you are using, you may need a
different value.

The Windows Resource Kit warns against going above 300.  Presumably, that
might cause fonts to print as square boxes or something.  :-|  (I'm not
smiling.)
