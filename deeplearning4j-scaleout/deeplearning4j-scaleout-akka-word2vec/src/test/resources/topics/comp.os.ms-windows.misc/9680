I would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few 
questions about Windows for Workgroups.

I currently have Novell Netware Lite which does not work with
Windows very well and is a conventional memory hog (ver. 1.1).
I am considering moving all our machines to W4WG.

Q1:  How much conventional ram does W4WG use over and above the
     driver for the network card?

Q2:  If I have a Novell NE2000 card, are the LSL and IPX drivers
     still needed?

Q3:  Does W4WG do a license check over the network to ensure each
     machine is running its own licenced copy of W4WG? (Note: I do
     not want to break the license agreement and I will buy a copy
     of W4WG for each of our machines, it is just that I would like
     to try it out first to see if it meets our needs. Returning one
     opened copy is much easier than returning N opened copies.)

Q4:  If you buy the upgrade to Windows 3.1 for W4WG does it replace
     all of Win 3.1 as you install it or does it depend on current
     Win 3.1 files?

Q5:  If I install Windows NT on my server when it comes out, will I have
     any troubles with the W4WG machines?

When I started this message, I was going to ask only 2 questions but I got carried
away. I'll stop now ;-).

I look forward to your replies.

Al
