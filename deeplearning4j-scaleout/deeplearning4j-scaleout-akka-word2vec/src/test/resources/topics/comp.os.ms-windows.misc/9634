I had this very same problem, and did 'work around' by turning parity checking off, but that only
worked while I was in windows, and the parity error would occur immediately after exiting
windows, however,the problem turned out to be 3 chip simms vs 9 chip simms.  I can't use 3 chip simms in my 
computer, and when I replaced them, the problem vanished, forever.
