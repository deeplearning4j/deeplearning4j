Time for a new discussion, maybe ? I asked in these groups some time ago
what about the TC++/VE, and got no answers, so I decided to try. My brother
who lives in the US bought and sent it to me, and I'm still trying to get
used to it.

Before I put my good/bad points list, consider I am a Turbo Pascal/DOS
programmer, and sometimes try to make something in Unix with C (just
some exercises from university). I used to make some programs in
Microsoft C version 5 (!!) because we used some third-party libraries
that required that. 
- I like Borland. It seems to me much more easier to use than Microsoft,
  specially the debugger. I tried to learn Codeview sometimes, but never
  felt confortable with it.
- TC++ V/E seems very nice to create simple apps, like the examples on the
  ObjectWindows book. So far, no problems. Lets see next week or so, when I
  will try something more complex.
- It works nice even in my "weak" machine 386/16Mhz, 6 Mb Ram. 

But.....

- The manual for the Resource Workshop seems to be from a different version 
  from the Workshop itself. Some of the windows that appear on the manual
  have more itens than in the manual.
- I think I will run into trouble since I got this TC++/VE from my brother
  as a present. I didnt wanted to buy the Japanese version because 1) I 
  suspect that the manuals will be in Japanese :-( and 2) I believe it
  will be far more expensive here. So he bought it as a present and sent to
  me, I send the registration card to the Japanese branch of Borland, but...
  who knows.

So, I'd like to ask some questions for you all;

- I know that there are some Microsoft guys around here in this group. Is
  there anybody from Borland ? Is there any e-mail address that we can 
  contact the technical support ? Not for stupid questions, but to ask
  for example, why the RW manual seems to be different from the RW itself ?
- Is there anybody else using it around here ?
- Will the book of Petzold be useful for me ? I intend to use RW and ProtoGen
  to make the interfaces and then work on the code itself. 

Answers to my e-mail or comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools, please.

Thanks in advance,

Rafael.
