Subject: Out of environment space running BAT files from Windows

I have a .BAT file that I run under a Windows Icon.  I have set up a PIF
file to run the BAT file in exclusive mode and to use the entire screen.
The first line of the BAT file sets an environment variable.

My problem is that on some of our machines (running MS-DOS 5.0 and Windows
3.1 in enhanced mode), the SET command in the BAT file fails with the
OUT OF ENVIRONMENT SPACE error.  I have raised the amount of environment 
space to 2048 bytes using the SHELL command in CONFIG.SYS so I know that
I am nowhere near to running out.  If I just click on the MS-DOS icon,
I can create a bunch of environment varibles from the DOS shell.  The problem
is that on some machines, setting the value of an environment variable in
a BAT file fails.  Has anyone seen such behavior before?  I see no place in the
PIF fail to configure environment space.
