I really appreciate this information.  However, given that I don't have
direct Internet access - which means I don't have Archie access - I must
resort to using FTPMAIL.  This means that I need the site name and the 
directory where these workspace managers are located.

So, can you (or anyone else) post or Email me the needed information?

Thanks very much!!!

Chris
