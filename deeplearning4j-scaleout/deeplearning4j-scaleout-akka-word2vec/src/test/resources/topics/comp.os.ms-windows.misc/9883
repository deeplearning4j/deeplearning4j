There are 3 alternatives:
1. You can try to write a small C program something like:

   int my_int_var;
   my_int_var = system("command");

   and display my_int_var value (which is the exit code of the command).

2. Or use 4dos.com instead of command.com (it has built in move command)
   you can also get any program exist code by using the exec function
   of 4dos:

   c:\>echo %@exec[command]

   will display the exit code of the command.

3. Get DOS 6, not worth buying if you already have QEMM/PCTools/Norton,
   and you only need the move utility.
