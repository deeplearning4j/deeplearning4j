Hi.

While running the MS Quick C compiler in a DOS window under Windows 3.1 
this evening, I got a "program has violated system integrity... close all 
applications, exit windows and restart your computer" error.

I started to do this when I immediately got a "Serious disk error" message
from Windows.  "hit return to retry".  I did that about 5 times and then
rebooted to find that quite a few files have been corrupted somehow.
(I am including the chkdsk output below.)

Questions:

1)  Is there an easy way to restore everything to working order?
What might be some better approaches?

2)  What might have caused this?  Does the SMARTDRV cache make me more
vulnerable?  (I'm suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they
cache data writing.)

The straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the /f option to 
fix the disk and then it looks like I would probably have to reinstall Windows
and a few other things.

Thanks for your comments and suggestions.

Brad Banko

ps:  this is a 386sx machine with a 40Mb hard drive and 2 Mb of RAM.
