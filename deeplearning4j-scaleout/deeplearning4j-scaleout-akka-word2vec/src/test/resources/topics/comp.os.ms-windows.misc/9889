This isn't entirely true. It is true that TrueType fonts are
larger than their ATM counterparts, but ATM fonts *do* get minimal
compression. Running Stacker 3.0 report generator, I get:

	 File Type:      Compression Ratio:
	 -------------   ------------------
	 *.TTF (TrueType)     1.4:1.0
	 *.PFB (ATM)          1.1:1.0
	 *.PFM (ATM Metric)  11.8:1.0

Although the metric files are small, they compress quite largely.
And, as you can see, even the regular .PFB files have *some* compression.

So, doing the math on one such comparitive font file:

TTF Times = 83260 bytes/1.4 = 59471 bytes (compressed)
PFB Times = 51549 bytes/1.1 = 46862 bytes (Compressed)

You still win out, even if the ATM Times font *isn't* compressed.

Your mileage may vary depending on compression program.
