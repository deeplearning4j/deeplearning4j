I am ordering the Actix graphicsengine ultra plus. It is the same price
as the stealth card. Plus it is also based on S3 928 chip the newest and
fastest chip from s3. 
Everyone, if you are looking for a card, SEE THE APRIL ISSUE OF PC MAGAZINE
FOR THEIR REVIEW.  
They noted this person's problem with dos. The stealth card is not a very good
dos performer. The Actix card is rated the best in this chip class (non local
bus). It got glowing reports from the magazine (was a best buy) and I called
them directly and they just updated their windows drivers last week! They have
a bulletin board to get the latest drivers. 
Though somone posted that this bbs was at 2400. 

AT any rate, the Actix graphics engine ultra outperforms all the other cards
in the 928 class (based on the winmark results).

If you are looking for the all around best dos/windows performance  check out
the actix card. Their 1-800 number is 927-5557.

P.S. The article in pc magazine noted that if you are a regular dos user (ie:
games) then you should also check out the 801 chip from s3. It apparently
scores just as well and in many cases slightly better in dos than the 928 chip
(ie: stealth and actix cards.) They have "comparable" windows performance and
are cheaper to buy.
