As the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of  
late.  It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  
day.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  
can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same  
application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  
that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  
need to re-boot.

Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  
first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  
GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  
(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  
machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  
the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  
the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  
was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  
board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  
SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  
fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.

The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  
rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  
the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. 

I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  
these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  
day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  
in the sppace of 20 minutes?

What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  
diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  
problem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After  
Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or  
gdi.exe.

Any help is truly appreciated.....
