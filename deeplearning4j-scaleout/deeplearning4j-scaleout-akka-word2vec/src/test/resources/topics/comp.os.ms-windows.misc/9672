Since swapping out my generic VGA card for a Diamod Speedstar 24X, I have 
noticed two new problems:

* if I create a windowed MS-DOS session (386 mode), when the text starts 
   to scroll, rather than printing characters it starts to print
   horizontal lines that spill out to the desktop and trash the entire 
   display.  Ctrl-alt-del terminates the dos window and restores the 
   desktop

* after a short time in NCD's PC X-remote for windows, all characters  
  displayed on the desktop are changed to be unreadable; I am unable to
  restore without rebooting.

These are in both 256 and 16 color 800x600 drivers, large and small fonts.
DOS 5, Win 3.1, emm386 and smartdrv installed.

I like the speed of the card and have had no other problems.  Any ideas?
Thanks!
