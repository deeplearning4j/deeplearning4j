Try WorkShift by Karl Thoreddson. The latest version is 2.0 (or later?) but
the following is at Cica in the Desktop directory.
WRKSFT16 ZIP : WorkShift Graphical Virtual Desktop (ver 1.6)

Or email Karl and ask him to put version 2.0 up
Karl's email: karlth@rhi.hi.is (from the MS-Write file of v1.6)

I was Beta tester for WorkShift and must say it is very good
(I gain nothing from saying that).
It'll even remember your WorkShifts (WorkSpaces as you said) between
Windows sessions.
