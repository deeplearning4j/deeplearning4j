This is silly. Is Unix a mature OS? Depends on who you ask, and how
you define mature. System 7 is, if anything, less mature than Windows 3.1.

So why do you need something like BeHierarchic to create groups under
the Apple Menu? Everyone knows that Apple Menu Items are a ripoff of
the Program Manager. If you want a hierarchic program launcher there
are lots available.

And this is easy on a Mac? Give me a break. Having spent hours moving
System Extensions around and restarting the Mac to see why a certain
app crashes all the time, I find this laughable.

Oh great. Ever hear of aliases? Wonder why Apple implemented them.

Eh?? I don't follow.

Why is it that I find the Mac desktop incredibly annoying whenever I
use it?

Yeah right. You post flame bait, yet ask for no flames.
