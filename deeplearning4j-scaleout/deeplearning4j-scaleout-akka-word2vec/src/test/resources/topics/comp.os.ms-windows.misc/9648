Hey now.  First of all, sorry to post this DOS question in a WINDOWS
group, but I'm in kinda a hurry, so I can't scramble to find the dos
groups' names.  

Anyway, anyone know where I ccan find the exit codes to DOS commands?
the manual doesn't seem to have all of them.  I'm particularly looking
for COPY, in order to make a "move" batch file, such that if the file
wasn't coppied properly, it won't be deleted.


please e'mail louray@seas.gwu.edu
Thanks, I.A,
Mickey
