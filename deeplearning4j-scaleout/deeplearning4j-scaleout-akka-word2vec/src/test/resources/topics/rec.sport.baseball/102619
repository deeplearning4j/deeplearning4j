  Well, it really isn't this cut and dry, but as a Jay fan the thing I feared
worst has happened. The Yanks sent down Williams G and are going to start
Williams B in CF.
  I also believe they kept Wickman and Millitello in their rotation, which is
much nicer than that Kaminiecki and Mike Witt combo I thought they'd throw
out their to the slaughterhouse because of their "experience". Granted, Witt
"might" be good, but I think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters
up and not given the job to Witt because he was a good pitcher and has
experience.
  The Yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards; the
Jays with the loss of Dave Stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their
pitching staff.
  The Orioles should also be there in the end.....
