Geez.  Everyone comes up with Clark, Williams, Thompson.  These guys
were all up in 1987.  That's ancient history.  So in the last 6 years,
noone, right?  Beck doesn't count.  I said 2 solid years.

Let's see what he does w/o the help of a pitchout every other pitch.
As I remember, even Bob Brenly had a good throwout percentage under
Roger Craig, who loved to sacrifice the count for runners being thrown
out.  Of course, he suffered from 3 ball 1 strike homers a lot too.
I am not a big fan of Manwaring.
