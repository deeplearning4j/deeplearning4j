I'm from Dallas, and you have alot of nerve saying that WFAN has a bunch of 
Hoodlum Mets fans.  During the football season, the local cowboy station here 
had the WIP on several times for simultanious broadcasts.  I have never heard  
a bigger bunch of low intellect, bed wetting ,obnoxious, woofing, cranial 
deformed, assholes in my entire life!  The IQ of the average eagles fan must 
be in the 10-15 range at best, and they have been known to be big droolers.
