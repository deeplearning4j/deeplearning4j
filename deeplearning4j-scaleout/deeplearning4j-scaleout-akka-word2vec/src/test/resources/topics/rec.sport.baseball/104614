Might? You'd have to have no sense of humor at all not to! My favorite
stuff are the Zero Heros, players who haven't hit homers in a long time, 
the LGTGAH (who is that named after, I can't remember), and the box score
line of the week. Incidentally, I just found out that the column has been
moved to Sundays. I get my Dad to send it to me up here in Boston every 
week. Great stuff!
