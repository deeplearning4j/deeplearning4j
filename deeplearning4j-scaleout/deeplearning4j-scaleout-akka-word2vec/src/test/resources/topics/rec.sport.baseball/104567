I would e-mail this to you, but my mailserver doesn't recognize you or
something.

Anyway, the worst pitcher on the Yanks. If you mean currently on the team,
then I have to go with Scott "I'm a schizophrenic...No, I'm NOT!"
Kamienicki. Sure, occasionally the guy can pitch well for 5 or 6 innings,
but then he starts to go insane. A sure sign that he's losing his stuff
(and his mind) is when he starts to stalk around the mound between batters
and yell at himself.

The worst all-time Yanks pitcher?  Gotta go with Ed "New York? I have to
pitch in [gulp] New York?" Whitson. 'Nuff said!
