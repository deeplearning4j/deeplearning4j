How about the following inaccurate, unsubstantiated accusations:
In 8257@blue.cis.pitt.edu
>Jim has been threatening
	- but no "threat" produced 
>once he realized that
	- display of telepathy
>threatening to quote me
	- in spite of no "threat" produced, nor forecast ever happening (precognition?)
>responding Jim's threat to quote me
	- in spite of claimed threat never being given
>Jim, preparing to...
	- in spite of it never happening.  telepathy or precognition?
>Jim again, still mystified
	- unsubstantiated and untrue.  more telepathy?  Or maybe telempathy?
>Jim, still scandalized
	- unsubstantiated again.  Seems to be a habit...
