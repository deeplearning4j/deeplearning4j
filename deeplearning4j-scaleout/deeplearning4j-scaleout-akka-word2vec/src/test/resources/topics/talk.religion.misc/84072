Of course it is.  It forms a very big part of your self-respect.  You come onto 
the board, thinking you're some sort of apologeticist for your faith, and you
routinely get roasted over a grill for stupid theories and unfounded assumptions.

I doubt that Sieferman has anything to do with you dropping out.  

It's probably closer to the truth to say that you don't have the cards to 
play in this game (because you insist on playing from a losing hand), and you're
finally realizing it.  You will lurk on the board, and keep 
quiet for a while, looking for an area where you are *certain* that you 
are correct, and then we'll see you pop back in again.  Of course, you then
will say that you have merely returned because your life is now "in order".

But we'll know better.
