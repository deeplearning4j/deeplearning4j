I don't think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his
sermon.  It's the deaths he's responsible for that concern most people.

Koresh was a nut, okay?  Just because he found ways for the Bible
to backup his rantings does not make him any less of a kook.

I'll type this very slowly so that you can understand.  He either set
the fire himself or told his followers to do so.  Don't make him out to

The evil was inside the compound.  All that "thou shalt not kill" stuff.
