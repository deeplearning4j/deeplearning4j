Where were you brought up?  In the former USSR?  Is Innocent until proven  
guilty by a jury of your peers, NOT Dan Rather, dead in this country?  Seems

death in this country, now?

"Not sure", yet you condem them to death for it?  If the BATF had stayed home,

Sleep well, tonite, heartless idiot.  Sleep the sleep of the simple-minded.

I shall weep for my country, myself.
