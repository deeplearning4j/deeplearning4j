That's closer, but I dislike "apps".  "software" (vs. "hardware")
would be better.  Would that engulf alt.graphics.pixutils?  Or would
that be "programmer"?

I don't know if traffic is really heavy enough to warrant a newsgroup
split.  Look how busy comp.graphics.research is (not).

It's true that a lot of the traffic here is rehashing FAQs and
discussing things that would probably be better diverted to
system-specific groups, but I don't know whether a split would help
or hurt that cause.

Maybe we need a comp.graphics.RTFB for all those people who can't be
bothered to read the fine books out there.  Right, Dr. Rogers? :-)
