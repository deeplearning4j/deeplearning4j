Actuallay I don't, but on the other hand I don't support the idea of having
one newsgroup for every aspect of graphics programming as proposed by Brian,
in his reply to my original posting.
I would suggest a looser structure more like a comp.graphics.programmer,
comp.graphics.hw_and_sw
The reason for making as few groups as possible is for the same reason you
say we shouldn't spilt up, not to get to few postings every day.
I takes to much time to browse through all postings just to find two or 
three I'm interested in.

I understand and agree when you say you want all aspects of graphics in one
meeting. I agree to some extension. I see news as a forum to exchange ideas,
help others or to be helped. I think this is difficult to achive if there
are so many different things in one meeting.

Good evening netters|-)
