The 3DO box is based on an ARM RISC processor, one or two custom graphics
chips, a DSP, a double-speed CDROM, and 2MB of RAM/VRAM. (I'm a little
fuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAM/VRAM capacity).

It was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the Electronic Cafe in
Santa Monica, CA. From 3DO, RJ Mical (of Amiga/Lynx fame) and Hal
Josephson (sp?) were there to talk about the machine and their plan. We
got to see the unit displaying full-screen movies using the CompactVideo codec
(which was nice, very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft)
... and a very high frame rate to boot (like 30fps).

Note however that the 3DO's screen resolution is 320x240.

CompactVideo is pretty amazing... I also wanted to point out that QuickTime
does indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was stated
above... I'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large size
then it would play back fine (I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit). The
price of generality... personally I don't use the dynamic sizing of movies
often, if ever. But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick
on the latest 040 machines.

I'm not sure how a Centris/20MHz 040 stacks up against the 25 MHz ARM in
the 3DO box. Obviously the ARM is faster, but how much?
