I recently saw a particular third party antenna on a new Camry (not mine,
but it caught my interest) and a new 626.  It seems to replace the
factory power antenna and is about a foot long made of plastic tubing.  I
have seen them on quite a few cars, but I can't find anything more about
them in previous r.a.c articles nor in r.a articles.

I'd like to know all I can, so any feedback is greatly appreciated.
