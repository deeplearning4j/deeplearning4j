	I agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to a
LOWER-END Ford Taurus.  A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still
be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.  A fully loaded
SL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be
somewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range.  A base Taurus (GL I believe) might
start around $15,000.  Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000
if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream
Taurus sedan.  Your statement was not entirely faulty, just a little
inaccurate.

Well, that's ok.  At least you're not bitching about dealer profits like some
of the other netters are.  You seem to have rationally picked out the car that
is best for you.  The Loyale is an aging design that is about to be replaced by
the Impreza wagon, so you probably got a good deal on one of the last ones.
