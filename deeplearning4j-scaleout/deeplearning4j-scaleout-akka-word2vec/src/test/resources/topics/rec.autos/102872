Lack of build quality was the thing  I notced on the first 2 LH's I
saw months back. The panel gaps were large and non-uniform between
the 2 cars I saw - the kind of thing you expect and accept on a
Mustang - but not from Chrysler's savior.  I drove one of the low
end cars, and thought it was more than adequate. I'd prefer
an LH to a Taurus from my brief experience.
