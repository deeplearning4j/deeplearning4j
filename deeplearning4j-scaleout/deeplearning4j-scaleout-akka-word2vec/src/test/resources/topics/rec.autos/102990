It depends on your priorities.  A lot of people put higher priorities
on gas mileage and cost than on safety, buying "unsafe" econoboxes
instead of Volvos.  I personally take a middle ground -- the only
thing I really look for is a three-point seatbelt and 5+mph bumpers.
I figure that 30mph collisions into brick walls aren't common enough
for me to spend that much extra money for protection, but there are
lots of low-speed collisions that do worry me.
