I rented an Oldsmobile Achieva (is that a yuppie name or what?) and a
Nissan Stanza.  They both had automatics.  I'm a manual transmission
bigot but I have to admit that the transmissions on these cars were
better shifters than I am.  And yes, they responded very quickly to
kickdown requests.  The Nissan had a tachometer so I was able to figure
out which gear I was in.  (The Olds may have also, but I don't
remember.)  I believe it shifted all the way down to second at about 50
mph when my foot told it, "No I really want to accelerate quickly."

I would still prefer a manual, but I won't delude myself into thinking
that I can out-accelerate a modern automatic.  And I'm very smooth at
shifting but certainly not as good as an automatic.
