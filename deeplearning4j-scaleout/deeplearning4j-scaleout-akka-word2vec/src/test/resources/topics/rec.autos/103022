i agree, *never* have the dealer add anything to your car.  if you want a/c
make sure it is factory installed(honda's maybe excluded, many can't be 
bought with a/c installed at the factory, but i think, maybe, they actually
use all the needed parts for a true factory install when they put one in...as
in bigger radiator etc...or are designed properly for this in the 1st place),
anyway, my point is the dealer installed a/c won't be anywhere near as good
as factory *and* the service bums will mess up your car when installing it...
scratches, screwdriver holes in seats...parts not reinstalled correctly or 
with all the screws etc.  i know a guy who has been service manager at a gm
dealer for 18 years...he said never have a dealer add anything to your car...
except, maybe, floormats...
