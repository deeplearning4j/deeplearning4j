  This last comment was obviously a bit cynical, but a true statement of
 the attitude of some drivers (there's your "autos" content), I would say.

  What law-abiding (not "low-abiding" as above (talk about Freudian slips!))
 citizens have the right and responsibility to do is try to PREVENT this
 type of behaviour in children.  A doctor may have to use "deadly force"
 against a part of a body (like amputating it) when an infection/disease
 has gone too far.  But his real desire would have been to *prevent* the
 disease in the first place or at least nip it in the bud.

   Followups should go to alt.parents-teens
