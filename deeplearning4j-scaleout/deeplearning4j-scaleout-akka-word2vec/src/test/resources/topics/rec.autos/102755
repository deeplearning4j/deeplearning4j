xA company here does it using polyurethene

xso there's not much of a track record here.
xIs the sprayed-on bedliner any good?  How
xwell do they hold up over the years?  Any
xinfo would be appreciated.

Do you have a Ziebart dealer in your area? They've offered spray
on bed liners around here for several years. If you do, see what
kind of a warranty they have. ( Unfortunately, I don't know anyone
who has gotten one so I can't help you there.) Also ask if they
can give you a list of references.
