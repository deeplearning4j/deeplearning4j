Hi from Australia,

I was wondering if anyone could send me any information of 
car shows, swap meets, drag meets, model car shows etc. during this period.
Can anybody tell me when the Pomona Swap meet is on this year?

Also, any places to visit (eg. car museums, private collections, 
your collection? etc. Any bit of information is appreciated!

I am also interested in finding some model cars (scale Models). 
I am intersted in 1968-1974 AMC cars. Of particular interest is:
1968-1970 AMX

you are interested.
