Sometimes a bad choke pull-off diaphram will cause a car to fast idle. The
pull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-cold
weather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. Locate the
fast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a
normal idle. If so, locate the diaphram and test it. If you can't apply
suction (via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose) with your mouth that will
cause the diaphram to retract, then it's bad and should be replaced.
