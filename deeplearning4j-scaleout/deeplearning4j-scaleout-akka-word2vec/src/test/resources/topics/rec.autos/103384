Sorry, by "they" I meant autobahns, not US freeways.

Well, I've driven in every state but Alaska, and drive about 60k per year.
I take long cross country trips any chance I get - its fun for me and I
can get reimbursment.
My job allows me to drive rather than fly. Not to labor the point, but
I've driven just about every freewayin the US, Germany, UK and France plus
some in Mexico, which was surpisingly good.

Yes, but as a %age of the total freeway in the US? 
All you have to do in this case is mark the hazard, advising people to
slow to 85 or so.

Texas freeways are varied, sometimes a good surface. Mostly flat. But,
I5 in CA is comparable and hilly.

Given the absence of other traffic and car built for 130 (e.g. 535) 
most US freeways are just fine. The problem is other road users and
cops.
