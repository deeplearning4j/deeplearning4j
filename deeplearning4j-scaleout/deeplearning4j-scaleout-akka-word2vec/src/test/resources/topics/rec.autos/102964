Well people fortunatly or unfortunatly ,
only the US is experiencing the devaluation of human life (among 
developed nations).

I am an American but I was raised in Europe, where the worst thing that 
can happen to somebody is get his car broken into, or have his pocket
picked by Slaves or Russian refugees.

Of cource there will be some nutcases, but thats extremely rare.

I.e. in Greece you can walk through any neighborhood at any time during
the night without even worrying.

In Germany , you can walk the sidewalks at 4.00 am and not even look 
behind your back, at the sanitation crews that clean the streets to a 
sparkling cleen.

Whoever of you have been there you know what I am saying.

I dont have any easy answers but if we as a nation do some selfcritisism
we might get somewhere.

Of course these postings sould be in soc.culture.US but if we reduce
crime here it 'll mean less car insurance rates ,thus we could spend
more money on modifing our cars. (Now my posting is rec.autos.tech 
revelant).
