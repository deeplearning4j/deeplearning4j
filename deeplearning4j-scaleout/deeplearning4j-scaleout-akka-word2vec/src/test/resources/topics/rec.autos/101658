	I just went through this mess in New Jersey (I'm still waiting for a
refund as well), namely, that the original company made a mistake and left me
in the lurch.  My recourse was through NJ's insurance dept. Office of Consumer
Protection.  You should have a similar office in your state.  Make use of it.

Good luck,
