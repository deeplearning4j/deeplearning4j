Of course you are a bunch of arrogant lawyers who know whats best for the 
rest of us. You are doing such a wonderful job with our judicial system,
getting all the criminals off, I bow to your superior intellect. Not to

speeding State Police officers, so you can soak is when we go to court.
I just love lawyer jokes! Don't you?
