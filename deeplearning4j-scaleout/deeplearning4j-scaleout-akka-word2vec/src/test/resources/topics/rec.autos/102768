Automotive Mailing Lists (Electronic Mail, that is):

[last updated 3/17/93; new lotus, exotic cars list subscription info;
   added Portland, OR motorsports list, Corvair list, Triumph TR8 list -- rpw]

There are a number of electronic mailing lists on the network devoted to
various special automotive topics.

To the best of my knowledge, all the lists appearing here have open
membership policies.  It is my policy not to list `closed' mailing lists
here.

Most mailing lists provide separate addresses for administrative
queries and for general mail; where separate administrative
addresses exist, I have listed those below, as the general addresses
are not appropriate for inquirys and requests.
