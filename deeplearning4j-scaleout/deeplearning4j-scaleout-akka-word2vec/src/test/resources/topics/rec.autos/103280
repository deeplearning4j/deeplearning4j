These substitutes exist, and at this time are available. Its the future
availability that is in doubt.

1) GHG-12

Get it from People's Welding Supply 800-382-9006


2) butane/propane  

You can mix this yourself so no one can ever regulate it away.
Just make sure you use good quality (dry) gases.


I don't know of any 200mpg carb distributors :-)
