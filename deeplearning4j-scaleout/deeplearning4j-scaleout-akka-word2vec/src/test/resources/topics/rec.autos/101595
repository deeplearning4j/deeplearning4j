Grass Roots Motorsport [3/93] has a long article about MG/B's this month.
As far as collectivity/speculation is concerned they think it is a 
waste of time, especially the later rubber bumpered models are the least
desirable, a 1962 original model the most. The reasons for its low
value are easy availability and the fact that it just was not a very good
car.
