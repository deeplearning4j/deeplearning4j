The quality of autobahns is something of a myth. The road surface
isn't much different to a typical TX freeway. They are better
in terms of lighting, safety, signs, roadmarkings etc. I'd have
no problem driving 130 on most US freeways, as it is, I save it
for the backroads, which really are more likely to be dangerous.

It would have to be quite severe. I don't recall any US freeway,
without road damage warnings, that i would regard as unsafe
at 130 in any decent, well damped car. Note that my definition
of decent, well damped, would exclude most typical American sedans.

I don't know where you live, but I would be much more worried
about cops, other traffic etc. than the road surface at 130.
It just isn't that fast or that dangerous. If you have a Probe
GT, no problem. The 4cyl models I have driven would be
likely to be unpredictable at higher speeds.
