I'm about to buy a new car and finance some of it.  Since I paid
cash for the last car I bought I did not have to worry about
whether or not I had a good amount of insurance on it because
of a bank loan.  I just put the amount that I wanted (not what
a bank would have wanted).  Friends are telling me that banks
require some kind of insurance on the car to protect it since it
is collateral on loans.  Is this true?  Can that insurance be
gotten as part of my other insurance?  I assume I don't have to
pay a dealer for extra insurance over my regular car insurance.
Am I correct?  I hear about accident/health type insurance at
the dealers and I am pretty sure these are just money makers
for them.  I just want to verify that I don't _have_ to buy
these at all.  Or any other types of extras.

What do I have to pay for?  Car, tax, license.  Anything else?

Ellen
