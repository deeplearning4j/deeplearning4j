It seems sad that people lose all perspective when they here about a
case of violence by teenagers...

For a little perspective:

How about the thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local
agencies to help children, seniors, the homeless?

Did you read about all the kids at Stanford who spent their spring
breaks helping out in inner city areas? What about the hundreds of
volunteers ( teenagers and others) who worked to clean up the mess
after the Rodney King riots in LA?

Have you gone to your local high school play recently? Attended the
school orchestra performances? Have you seen how many kids volunteer
to pick up trash, plant trees, do walk-a-thons? How many kids have
tried to sell you stuff to benefit organizations they belong to? How
many girl scout cookies have you bought? How many chocolate bars for
good causes?

The media picks up on all the anomalies, the sensational...

What about the wonderful teenagers all over the place who work hard at
school, get good grades, go to college (or to work) and make a real
contribution to our society?

All humans are teenagers at some time in their lives! Mother Theresa
was a teenager and so was Geoffrey Dahmer.

It is really sad to see so many people who buy the sensational
reporting of the media as some kind of reflection of the world today!
It is a reflection of what is happening on the outer fringes of our
society and nothing more...
