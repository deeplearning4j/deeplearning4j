As you can see, I have two 1987 cars, both worth about $3000 each.
The problem is that maintenance costs on these two cars is
running about $4000 per year and insurance $3000 per year.

What am I doing wrong?

Within the last two months, the follows costs have occured:

Dodge 600 SE (Dodge's attempt at the American German car!)

$1,000 - replace head gasket
$300   - new radiator

Chevy Nova CL (Chevy's attempt at a Japan import!)

$500 - tune-up,oil change,valve gasket,middle exhaust pipe, misc.

Note also that the Chevy Nova CL (1987) has only 70 horsepwer!
Does anyone out there have a Chevy Nova with enough power
to get up even a small hill without knocking? Is there
something wrong with my car, I even use 93 octane gas!
(I have consider going to 110 octane if I can find it!)

Anyway, what are the best maintenance items to do-it-yourself,
and what equipment is needed? 

            Thanks,
            -Doug (2 car Doug from Wayne,NJ)
