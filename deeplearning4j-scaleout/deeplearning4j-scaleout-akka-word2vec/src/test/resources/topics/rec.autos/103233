My wife and I looked at, and drove one last fall. This was a 1992 model.
It was WAYYYYYYYYY underpowered. I could not imagine driving it in the
mountains here in Colorado at anything approaching highway speeds. I
have read that the new 1993 models have a newer, improved hp engine. 

I'm quite serious that I laughed in the salesman face when he said "once
it's broken in it will feel more powerful". I had been used to driving a
Jeep 4.0L 190hp engine. I believe the 92's Land Cruisers (Land Yachts)
were 3.0L, the sames as the 4Runner, which is also underpowered (in my
own personal opinion). 

They are big cars, very roomy, but nothing spectacular.
