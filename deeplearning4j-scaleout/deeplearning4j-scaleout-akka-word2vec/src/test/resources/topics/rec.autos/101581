Car and Driver rated the 325is (1988) at 7.2 0-60 , 1/4 at 15.2 (after 30k miles) last time I checked 8#}.

Automobile magazine rated new 325is 1/4 mile@16.2.

Gee , aint quotiin funner than the dickens!

Sounds like we need a race.  I'll let you have the newer version.  Can someone out there lend me a 1988 325is for a day 8-].  I wont hurt it, I promise.

>i don't know how the addition of variable valve timing for 1993 affects it.
>but don't take my word for it.  go drive it.

Actually I will take your word on it.  I refuse to test it (new 325is) because
I love BMW's and would probably want to buy it.  Problem is, my income just doesn't support that.
