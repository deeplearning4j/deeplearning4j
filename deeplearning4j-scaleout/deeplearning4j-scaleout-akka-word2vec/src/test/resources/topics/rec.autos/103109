I have to disagree with this.  I have a 92 Z28 with a 350 and a 4-speed auto
w/ overdrive, and it is really better that way.  Chevy autos are reknowned
for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power.  I live 
in the Dallas area, and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic 
here.  Now if I still lived out in the sticks like I used to, a manual would be
more fun.  

Safety-wise, an auto is less distracting...I would hate to have to be    
shifting gears while I was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here.
Performance-wise, I can hold my own against any stock 5.0 Mustang or 5.0
Camaro w/ a five speed.  

All of this IMHO... :)
