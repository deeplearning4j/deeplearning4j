Dangerous only to immune suppressed persons and fetuses.  To them,
it is extremely dangerous.  Most of the rest of us have already had
it and it isn't dangerous at all.

Cat feces are the worst.  Pregnant women should never touch the litter box.

Cook your meat.  Watch it with pets.

Of course, it can't reverse damage already done, such as in
a fetus.
