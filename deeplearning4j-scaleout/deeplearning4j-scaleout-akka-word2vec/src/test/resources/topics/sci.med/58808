A(> A woman I know is tapering off klonopin. I believe that is one of the
A(> benzodiazopines. She is taking a very minimal dose right now, half a tablet
A(> a day. She is also pregnant. My question is Are there any known cases where
A(> klonopin or similar drug has caused harmful effects to the fetus?
A(>  How about cases where the mother took klonopin or similar substance and had
A(> normal baby. Any information is appreciated. She wants to get a feel for
A(> what sort of risk she is taking. She is in her first month of pregnancy.

Klonopin, according to the PDR (Physician's Desk Reference), is not a
proven teratogen.  There are isolated case reports of malformations,
but it is impossible to establish cause-effect relationships.  The
overwhelming majority of women that take Klonopin while pregnant have
normal babies.
