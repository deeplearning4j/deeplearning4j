            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new
program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon 
University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific 
communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and 
January 1994.


PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the 
United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers
experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is 
facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and
laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop
long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.


PROGRAM DESIGN
To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to 
develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and
its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:

1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE
Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses
designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a
relatively short time.

2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE
A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the
cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in 
manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a 
variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,
Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums
will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or 
research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.


3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN
Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, 
participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,
and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan
will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.


FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS
STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.
