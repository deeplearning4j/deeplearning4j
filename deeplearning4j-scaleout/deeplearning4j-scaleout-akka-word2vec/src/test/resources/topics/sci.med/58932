In Holland insurences pay for Homeopathic treatment. In Germany they do
so as well. I Austria they do if you have a condition which can not be 
helped by "normal" medicine (happened to me). Switzerland seems to be 
the same as Austria (I have direct experience in the Swiss case).

At the Univeristy of Vienna (I believe Innsbruck as well) homeopathy
can be taken in Med. school.

I found that in combination with Acupuncture it changed my life from
living hell to a condition which enables me to lead a relatively 
normal life. I found that modern medicine was powerless to cure me
of a *severe* case of Neurodermitis (Note: I mean cure, not 
surpress the symptoms, which is what modern medicine attempts to 
do in the case of Neurodermitis). 

I'm not saying that Homeopathy is scientific, but that it can offer 
help in areas in which modern medicine is absolutely helpless.

From reading your aritcle it seems that your have some deeply rooted
beliefs about this issue (this is not intended to be offensive or 
sarcastic - it just sounded like that to me) which makes me doubt 
if you can read this with an open mind. If you do/can, please excuse
my last comment.
