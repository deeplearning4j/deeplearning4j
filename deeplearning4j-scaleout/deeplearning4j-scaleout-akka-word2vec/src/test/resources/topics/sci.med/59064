Summary: How to adjust to 9000 ft when you come from sea-level

I live at sea-level, and am called-upon to travel to high-altitude cities
quite frequently, on business.  The cities in question are at 7000 to 9000
feet of altitude.  One of them especially is very polluted...

Often I feel faint the first two or three days.  I feel lightheaded, and
my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sea-level.  Also, it is very
dry in these cities, so I will tend to drink a lot of water, and keep
away from dehydrating drinks, such as those containing caffeine or alcohol.

Thing is, I still have symptoms.  How can I ensure that my short trips there
(no, I don't usually have a week to acclimatize) are as comfortable as possible?
Is there something else that I could do?

A long time ago (possibly two years ago) there was a discussion here about
altitude adjustment.  Has anyone saved the messages?

Many thanks,

Vida.
