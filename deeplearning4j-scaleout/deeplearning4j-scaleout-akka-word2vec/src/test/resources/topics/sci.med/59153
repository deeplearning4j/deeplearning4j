It made me really BITCHY for the first few weeks.  Now that I think about
it I was having some bizarre dreams too.  My doctor said it made him feel
like he had to be DOING something all the time.  But if you keep taking it,
after a few weeks these symptoms seem to go away, he said hang in there.  
I did and they did.
