Seems to me that I read in either a recent NY Times
Science Times or maybe it was Science News that there is
evidence that ex-smoker's risk of lung cancer never returns
to that of a person who has never smoked (I think it may
get close).  I'll find the article and post it since my
memory is hazy on the specifics - if you are interested.
