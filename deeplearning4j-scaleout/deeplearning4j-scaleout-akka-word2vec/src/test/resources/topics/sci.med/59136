Yes.

It seems to work equally well for CFS, another hint that these may be
different facets of the same underlying process.
 
>Have you gotten good results with it?
 
Yes.  The benefit is usually evident within a few days of starting it.
Most of the patients for whom it has worked well continued low-dose
amitriptyline, daily aerobic excersise, and a regular sleep schedule
(current standard therapy).  Because of the cost (usually > $150/mo.,
depending on dose) and potential for significant side effects like
corneal injury and birth defects, I currently reserve it for those who
fail conventional treatment.  It is important that the person
prescribing it have some experience with it and follow the patient
closely.

As far as I know, I am the only person looking at it currently.  I
should get off my duff and finish writing up some case reports.  I'm not
an academic physician, so I don't feel the pressure to publish or perish
and I don't have the time during the work day for such things.
