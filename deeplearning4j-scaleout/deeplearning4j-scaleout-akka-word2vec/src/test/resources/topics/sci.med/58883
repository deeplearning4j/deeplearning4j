 If you notice the question mark at the end of the sentence, I was
 addressing that very question to that person (who has a dog named
 sugar) and a few other people who seem to be of the same opinion.

 I would love to have anyone come up with a study to support their
 claims that the placebo effect is more prevalent with alternative
 compared to conventional medicine.
 Perhaps the study could also include how patients respond if they
 are dissatisfied with a conventional versus an alternative doctor,
 i.e. which practitioner is more likely to get punched in the face
 when the success of the treatment doesn't meet the expectations of 
 the patient!
