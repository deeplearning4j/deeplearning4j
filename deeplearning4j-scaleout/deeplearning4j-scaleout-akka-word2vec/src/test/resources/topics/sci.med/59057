Can someone tell me whether or not any of the following medications 
has been linked to rapid/excessive weight gain and/or a distorted 
sense of taste or smell:  Hismanal; Azmacort (a topical steroid to 
prevent asthma); Vancenase.

Also:
You may have guessed, I'm an allergy sufferer--but I'm beginning to 
suspect I'm also the victim of a Dr. toliberal with the prescription 
p. The allergist I went to last Oct. simply inquired about my symptons 
( I was suffering chronic asthma attacks), gave me a battery of 
allergy tests, and went down a checklist of drugs (a photocopied 
sheet).  I've gained out 30 lbs. since then though I haven't eaten 
more or much differently than before; I'vsuffered depression; , 
fatigue; and I've experienced a foul smell and sense of taste for 
about the last two months.  I mentioned the lack of smell and taste to 
this Dr. in Feb. and he said my sinuses did look a bit swollen (he 
just looked up my nose with his little light--the same one used for 
ears), and prescribed Prednisone and Sulfatrim DS (severe headaches 
and a rash resulted, particularly after my week's worth of Prednisone 
ran out).  Now he wants to do a rhinoscopy to see if I have a bleeding 
ulcer or polyps in my sinus cavities.  I'm considering seeing another 
doctor.  Any suggestions/advice?  I'd really appreciate it!
