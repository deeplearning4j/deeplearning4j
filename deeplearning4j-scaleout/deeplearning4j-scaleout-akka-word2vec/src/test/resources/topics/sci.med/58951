  Ron Roth recommends: "Once you have your hypoglycemia CONFIRMED through the 
                        proper channels, you might consider ther following:..."
                        [diet omitted]

1) Ron...what do YOU consider to be "proper channels"...this sounds suspiciously
like a blood chemistry...glucose tolerance and the like...suddenly chemistry 
exists? You know perfectly well that this person can be saved needless trouble 
and expense with simple muscle testing and hair analysis to diagnose...no
"CONFIRM" any aberrant physiology...but then again...maybe that's what you meantby "proper channels."

2) Were you able to understand Dick King's post that "90% of diseases is not thesame thing as 90% of patients" which was a reply to your inability to critically
evaluate the statistic you cited from the New England Journal of Medicine. Couldyou figure out what is implied by the remark "Of course MDs are ethically bound to not knowingly dispense placebos..."?

3) Ron...have you ever thought about why you never post in misc.health.alterna-
tive...and insist instead upon insinuating your untrained, non-medical, often 
delusional notions of health and disease into this forum? I suspect from your
apparent anger toward MDs and heteropathic medicine that there may be an
underlying 'father problem'...of course I can CONFIRM this by surrogate muscle
testing one of my patients while they ponder my theory to see if one of their  
previously weak 'indicator' muscles strengthens...or do you have reservations
about my unique methods of diagnosis? Oh..I forgot what you said in an earlier
post.."neither am I concerned of whether or not my study designs meet your or
anyone else's criteria of acceptance."
