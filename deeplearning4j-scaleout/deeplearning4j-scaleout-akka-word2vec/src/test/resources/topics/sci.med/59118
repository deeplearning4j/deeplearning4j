Ever heard of something called the placebo effect? I think Dyer is
reacting because it looks to be yet another case of the same old
quackery over and over again.

It true that current medical knowledge is limited, but do you realize
just HOW MANY quacks exist eager to suck your $$$$. It's playing the
lottery at best.

If the results you got were so clear and obvious, would you mind
trying a little experiment to see if it is true? It would be quite
simple. Have sugar pills and have real pills.  Take one set for one
week and the other set for another week without knowing which ones are
the real pills. Then at the end of the 2 weeks compare the results.
Let's say you're wife would know which are the real ones. If what you
are experiencing is true there should be a marked difference between
each week.
