  I'm glad it caught your eye. That's the purpose of this forum to
 educate those, eager to learn, about the facts of life. That phrase
 is used to bridle the frenzy of all the would-be respondents, who

 consulted on that topic. In short, it means absolutely nothing.

 Muscle testing and hair analysis, eh?  So what other fascinating 
 space-age medical techniques do you use?  Do you sit under a pyramid
 over night as well to shrink your brain back to normal after a mind-

 Once I figure out what *you* are trying to say, I'll still have 
 to wrestle with the possibility of you conceivably not being able

 Oh man, when are you going to start teaching all this stuff?  I'll
 bet everyone on this net must be absolutely dying to learn more about 
 going beyond spinal adjustments and head straight for the mind for
