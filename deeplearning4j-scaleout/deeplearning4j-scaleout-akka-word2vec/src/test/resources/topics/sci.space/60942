It is usually possible to reach people at IKI (Institute for Space
Research) in Moscow by writing to

	IKIMAIL@esoc1.bitnet

This is a machine at ESA in Darmstadt, Germany; IKI has a dedicated
phone line to this machine and someone there logs in regularly to
retrieve mail.

In addition, there are several user accounts belonging to Russian
scientific institutions on

	<user>@sovam.com

which is a commercial enterprise based in San Francisco that provides
email services to the former USSR.  For example, fian@sovam.com is the
"PHysics Institute of the Academy of Sciences" (initials transliterated
from Russian, of course).  These connections cost the Russians real
dollars, even for *received* messages, so please don't send anything
voluminous or frivilous.
