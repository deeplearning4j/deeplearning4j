   Announce that a reward of $1 billion would go to the first corporation 
   who successfully keeps at least 1 person alive on the moon for a
   year. 

And with $1B on offer, the problem of "keeping them alive" is highly
likely to involve more than just the lunar environment! 

"Oh Dear, my freighter just landed on the roof of ACME's base and they
all died.  How sad.  Gosh, that leaves us as the oldest residents."

"Quick Boss, the slime from YoyoDyne are back, and this time they've
got a tank!  Man the guns!"

One could imagine all sorts of technologies being developed in that
sort of environment.....

(I'm kidding, BTW, although the problem of winner-takes-all prizes is
that it encourages all sorts of undesirable behaviour - witness
military procurement programs.  And $1b is probably far too small a
reward to encourage what would be a very expensive and high risk
proposition.)
