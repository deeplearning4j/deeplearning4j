Also in pure speculation:

Parity errors in memory or previously known conditions that were waivered.
   "Yes that is an error, but we already knew about it"

Any problem where they decided a backup would handle it.

Any problem in an area that was not criticality 1,2,3..., that is, any
   problem in a system they decided they could do without.

I'd be curious as to what the real meaning of the quote is.
