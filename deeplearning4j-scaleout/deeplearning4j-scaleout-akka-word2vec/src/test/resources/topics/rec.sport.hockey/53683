	You know what Frank? It's not David Poile's fault that the Caps
have mired in mediocrity for so long. Blame it on the owner, Abe Polin!
This guy owns both the NBA's Bullets and the NHL's Capitals. How dumb
and selfish could this guy be? He's unwilling to spend the bucks in 
order to get a big star to Landover...no wonder both teams STINK!

	I've heard that the Capitals had a chance to get Detroit's
Steve Yzerman last summer but they pulled out at the last minute. Why?
Because our good man, Abe, is afraid to spend the cash!

	Nevertheless, I'm still faithful and hoping that one day
this devilish dictator will be replaced.
