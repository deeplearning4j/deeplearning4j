Agreed here...I'll never forget Dan Kelly calling the play-by-play in the '87
Canada Cup.  He was masterful!

And Danny Gallivan will _never_ be replaced; even now when I watch HNIC I
remember his voice...when I see an Al MacInnis or Al Iafrate (hey, what's with
these guys named Al who can shoot??) shot from the point I still think
"blistering blast"...THN had a tribute to Gallivan in the issue following his
death; in the story they included a quote from one of the games he did.  It
went: 

"It appears Risebrough has pugnaciously construed that check," he said, "and 
will undoubtedly make a visitation to the box of punition."

Classic, vintage Gallivan!  He's sorely missed.  So here's to two of the best
there was and best that ever will be.
