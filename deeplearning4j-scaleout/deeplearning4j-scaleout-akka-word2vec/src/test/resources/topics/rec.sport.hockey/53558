  Derian Hatcher's game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the NHL, 
allowing the Minnesota defenseman to play in the North Stars' last two 
regular-season games.  Hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at 
the end of a loss at St. Louis on Sunday, April 11.  But the league 
didn't rescind the game-misconduct penalty Shane Churla received.  The 
Stars recalled center Cal McGowan from their top minor league club in 
Kalamazoo, Mich., to replace Churla.

Now, here's where I need help.  If anyone out there has a tape of Tuesday's
Chicago-Minnesota game, please contact me.  Terms will be favorable.

Also, if anyone can tape tonight's Minnesota-Detroit game, please contact
me.  This could be quite important.  Once again, I will make it worth
your trouble.

Thanks to all.
