: Bri, as I have tried to tell you since 2 February, Michael O'Neill
: might be the most underrated goalie in the AHL, but he ISN'T in the
: AHL.  He's on the Winnipeg Jets' injury list, as he has been since
: his first NHL start against the Ottawa Senators.  He's out until
: next year after surgery to repair a shoulder separation.

: Stu Barnes might be an AHL gun for the Hawks, but he's now the third
: line center with the Jets, and has been since mid January or so.

Sorry, my memory is gone. I thought that O'Neill got sent back
down in February but I must have been given incorrect info. I guess
this says it all about Moncton because Barnes is still one of
their top 3 or so scorers even though he's been out since January.
