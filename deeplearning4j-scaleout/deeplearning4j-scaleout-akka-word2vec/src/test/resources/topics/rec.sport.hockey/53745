What is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus WC?
I know that the Rangers are holding back Kovalev, Zubov, and Andersson for
Binghamton, but I also know that the Whalers wanted Michael Nylander to play
for Springfield, while Nylander wanted to play for Sweden. The Whalers allowed
the NHL to decide, and the NHL chose the WCs. How does this differ from the
Rangers and Oilers? Did the Whalers have to go through the league, or could
they have forced Nylander to play in Springfield?
