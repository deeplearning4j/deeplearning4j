Well, since someone probably wanted to know, here's this year's playoff
matchups on the left, and what the matchups would be next year under the
new alignment and playoff-matchup rules.  The same 16 teams make the playoffs
under next year's rules, and three of the first round matchups are the same
(QUE-MTL, CHI-STL, VAN-WIN).
