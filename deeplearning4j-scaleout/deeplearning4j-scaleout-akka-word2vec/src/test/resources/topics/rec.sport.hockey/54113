Perish the thought...but you know, you may be right, at least as far
as MAJOR LEAGUE professional sports teams go.  They all seem to be
becoming BIG MONEY games, much more so than at any previous time.  To
think that if I am ever able to move back home several years from now,
all that may be there is an AHL team, at best...SIGH.

The interesting thing is that the NHL is also expanding, at the same
time as it is dramatically increasing the amount of money needed to
operate a team.  This would seem to indicate that there's a BIG
shake-out about to occur in the next few years, unless player salaries
can somehow be brought under control.  Frankly, I don't see how the
NHL's current drive for expansion is supportable under its current
operating conditions.  If revenue sharing AND a salary cap don't come
into the NHL soon, look out.
