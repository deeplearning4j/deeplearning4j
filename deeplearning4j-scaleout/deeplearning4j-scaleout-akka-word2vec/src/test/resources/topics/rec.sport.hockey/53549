Nice try Deepak, but "tough Whaler squad" should have clued you in to the
fact that my Leaf woofing was tongue-in-cheek.

If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then
it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times
in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will
be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that is
only for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with
injuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really
rather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say this
for sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I
don't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically
human attitudes.  

With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing 
money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff
"take" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely
to consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are
going to come back with "winning spirit" and all of that crap but these
players are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the 
game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make
a decent living. 

Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is 
being paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his
job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.

The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions
of the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top 
after the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely
accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and "hot".  The 
emphasis on the playoffs, with their "sudden death" appeal has been promoted
by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh
loses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the
league over the year.  They proved it.

cordially, as always,
