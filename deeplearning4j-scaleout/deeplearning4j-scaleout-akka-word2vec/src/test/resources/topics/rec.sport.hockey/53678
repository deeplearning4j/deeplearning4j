So in other words, if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out
the Penguins, that's immaterial because it was the coaches decision? Come on,
Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant.
Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams
is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two
goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good
teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context
of comparing two goaltenders.

YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.
Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you
get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a
coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you
have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto
game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in
that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same
for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a
great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If
you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.

But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie
stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel
doesn't have a game like that in him.

Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about
Roussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen
at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was
to have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah,
Dom has played well too.

FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a
team picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the
same picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning,
Kasper...

Mostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain
autographs on the team photos. I don't like that method since I've seen
guards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they
got their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies.
