I would have chosen Alex Zhitnik for biggest suprise.  They
did expect that he would become a great defenseman, but I don't
think anyone knew that he was going to be this impressive in his 
rookie year.  His speed, skating ability, and puck control is
exceptional -- he is the one to watch on the Kings.
