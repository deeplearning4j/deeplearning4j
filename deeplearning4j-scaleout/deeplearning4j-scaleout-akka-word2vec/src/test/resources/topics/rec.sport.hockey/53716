True, coach Matikainen is ready to keep a spot for Teemu all the way
until the medal games. He wants Teppo Numminen, too. And Kurri, but for
them the spots cannot be left open for too long. Esa Tikkanen we have
already. 

Even without these players I think we have pretty good team. Young,
hungry, talented guys, no old players that have got everything (except
the gold). Yesterday's practise game, SWE-FIN 6-6, shows that the two
world's best hockey teams ;) are in prime shape.  The Finn line
Riihijarvi(slightly injured)-Saarikoski-Viitakoski shined. I bet these
two teams are the best in the NHL, too. Roger, Roger?

What do you people think about Team Canada with Lindros, Brind'Amour,
Burke, Ranford, Recchi, Dineen...? Can they beat the Finns:?
