Ok, but have you seen Tabaracci play yet?  In his two starts and
his relief effort for Beaupre, he has looked mighty sharp - don't
forget the shutout.  I think he's let in just four goals over eight
periods of play.  I like Hrivnak, but we might actually have to give
some credit to David Poile for a change after this trade.

Hopefully if Tabaracci starts against the Isles tonight, I haven't
jinxed him.
