But ultimately their hockey philosophies are like night and day...
Keenan believes in pressuring the opposition and taking the
initiative (within the limits of his system)...while Roger
has a reactive hockey philosophy...which is why Messier will
be able to and has played for Keenan, but thought Roger's way
was a sure loser.

Roger is a great assistant coach...but considering what must be bad
blood between Nielson and Messier, it would be a mistake to bring
him back even in that role.
