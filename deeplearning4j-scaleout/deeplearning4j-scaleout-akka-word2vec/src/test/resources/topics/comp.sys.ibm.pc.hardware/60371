I got two very similar sounding boards for dirt cheap, too. Their Assy
numbers were not 4000-series, but your description fits otherwise. They
are 3Com 3C505's aka Etherlink Plus cards. Check out ftp.3com.com, there
are drivers and diagnostic programs for just about any and all 3Com
cards. I concluded that my card was the 505 after I ran their diagnostic
program for 3C505 succesfully ("..passes with flying colours") :)

Anybody know of packet drivers for these cards under OS/2..?
