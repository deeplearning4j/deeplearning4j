Subject: Perfect MAG MX15F Monitors?

I've been intently following the MAG thread while waiting for
mine to arrive in the mail. There seems to be a lot of
complaints about minor alignment problems with the MX15F. One
article contained a comment that the owner called the factory
and was told that his screen rotation was within spec (1/4").

Well, my monitor arrived last night and, sure enough, it has
a very noticable barrel distortion. It's not dramatic, but it
is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't
fill the entire screen. The fact that it is worse on the right
side doesn't help matters.

What I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections
are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? I don't want
to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse
problem. Does the factory consider this kind of thing normal
and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment? 
Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?
