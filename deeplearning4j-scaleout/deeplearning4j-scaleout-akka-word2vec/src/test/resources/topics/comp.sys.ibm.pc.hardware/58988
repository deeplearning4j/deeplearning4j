Hi,
I've got a Multi I/O card (IDE controller + serial/parallel
interface) and two floppy drives (5 1/4, 3 1/2) and a
Quantum ProDrive 80AT connected to it.
I was able to format the hard disk, but I could not boot from
it. I can boot from drive A: (which disk drive does not matter)
but if I remove the disk from drive A and press the reset switch,
the LED of drive A: continues to glow, and the hard disk is
not accessed at all.
I guess this must be a problem of either the Multi I/o card
or floppy disk drive settings (jumper configuration?)
Does someone have any hint what could be the reason for it.
Please reply by email to GERTHD@MVS.SAS.COM
Thanks,
Thomas
