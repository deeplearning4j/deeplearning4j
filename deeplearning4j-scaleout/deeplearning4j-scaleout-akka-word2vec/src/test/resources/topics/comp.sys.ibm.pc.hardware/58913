Hi. I recently switched my old Amiga 500 with a 486DX-50. My computer
configuration is :

486DX-50 Mhz. 8/256 kB EISA (Micronics Motherboard ASIC EISA 50Mhz)
16MB Ram
ST3283N 248 MB Harddisk, SCSI
UltraStor24F EISA Cache Controller

When I use Norton6.0 Harddisk benchmark, I get a Harddisk data transfer
about 980 kb/sec. and sometimes 1MB/sec. Is that good ? I thought
that with EISA I could get about 2MB/sec. 
Somewhere in the manual for my harddisk I have read, that some host 
adapters need to perform a low-level format to optimize the harddisk 
performance in that system, do I need that ?
A guy I know, gets a HD transfer about 1.2MB/sec, and he has an ST3283A and
a ISA 486DX-50, how can a ISA with the same system be faster ?

Is there anything that I can do to get a speedier harddisk ?


                                        Thanks.
