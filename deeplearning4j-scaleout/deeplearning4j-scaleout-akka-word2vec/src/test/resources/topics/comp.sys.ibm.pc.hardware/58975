As most of you know, we have recently changed our standard VESA local-bus
video card from our own NCR-based card to the new Diamond Stealth 24 VLB card
for packages 2, 3, and 4 (package #1 still has the NCR "screamer').  We also have
added the $149 upgrade from the Stealth 24 or NCR to the Diamond Viper to our
product list.  Below are the comparisons of the different cards in the
configurations we will offer:

*    Viper VLB with 2M of video RAM also gives 8OOx6OO 16.7M, 1024x768 32K &
     64K, and 1280xl 024 256 color.  S3-based cards, since they are downward
     compatible, will have the conflict with 2E8.  Diamond admits conflict will
     exist with the Stealth 24.  The prelim Viper manual incorrectly lists the 
     S3 port addresses.  No conflict. 


**   AutoCAD 12 drivers are now currently available for Stealth, SpeedSTAR
     24X, Stealth 24 VLB, and Viper VLB.  They can only be obtained from
     Diamond Tech Support, 408-736-2000 and NOT on any BBS. 

**   OS/2 2.0 is supported for Standard VGA for all cards.  SVGA drivers
     available in the near future.  Windows NT is not released yet, and no
     drivers are available currently.  Diamond hopes to have all current
     products supported in the Win NT release, on the NT disks.

***  NCR testing is coming from tests ran in our tech support department was 
    at ZEOS at 1024x768x256 on Zeos DX2-66. These results are not official.
    Diamond results are from their own DX2-66, 1024x768 256 colors @ 7OHz 
    refresh.
