Would someone please email me the pinout for a PS/2 6-pin mini DIN mouse
port?  I'm trying to make an adapter for a serial mouse, and the dealer who
knows what adapter works with the mouse I bought doesn't have it in stock.
I have several different adapters, but none of them make sense based on
what sketchy information I have about the port (they have connections to
"reserved" pins).
