: try a bios level format via the debug command.
: -G=xxxx:5  where xxxx is the Hex address of the hd controller bios
: location.
: if this will not work, a last resort would be to take a large magnet
: to the hard disk, but this has to be done properly or you will cause
: or could cause more damage than has been done already.

: disclaimer: I am not responsible for your actions by directly applying
: a large magnet to your hard disk.

: if done correctly the magnet trick will wipe out everything on the
: hard disk _COMPLETELY_ and a low level BIOS format might succeed
