     No, you need not bypass the config.sys, in Dos 6.0, there is a function 
of multi-config, have you tried BOOT.SYS ? the multi-config is the kind that 
you can choose you config.sys at the startup. And I find that is very good. 
It has no conflict to QEMM. (I have problem when using BOOT.SYS)
    The key you say is F8, which is trace the config.sys step by step.
    Sorry, if any error :)
