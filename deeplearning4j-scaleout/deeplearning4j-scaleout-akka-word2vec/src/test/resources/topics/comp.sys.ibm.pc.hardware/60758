!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There is explicitly NO WARRANTY
that the given settings are correct or harmless. (I only collect, I do
not check for myself!!!). There is always the possibility that the
settings may destroy your hardware!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Since I hope however that only well-minded people undergo the effort of
posting their settings the chance of applicability exists. If you should
agree or disagree with some setting, let me know immediately in order
to update the list.

If you possess a HD not mentioned here of which you know BIOS and/or
jumper settings, please mail them to me for the next update of the list!

Only IDE (AT-Bus) Harddisks will be accounted for.
If not specified the Landing Zone should be set equal to the number of
cylinders. If not specified the 'Write Precompensation' should be set
65535. (There are BIOSes that don't even ask for it).

Another statement (maybe right):
IDE harddisk don't have Precomp and LZone. The precomp is a built-in parameter
and lzone isn't used because most if not every IDE disk has autopark.

The jumpers' names are given as printed on the HD's board, often only a
jumper number (JP12 means the jumper '12'). A zero means that the jumper
is left open, a one means that the jumper is closed.

IDE/AT

Conner drives are low level formatted at the factory. It is only necessary
to run SETUP, FDISK, and DOS FORMAT.

BIOS SETTINGS

BIOS setting for the M2614ET in my system is 667 cylinders, 33 sectors
and 16 heads.

> I was trying to set my IDE drive in the subject above to a slave drive for
> A Conner 170MB drive and contacting the support company gave me this answer (which works). The factory default on SW2 is On Off Off Off Off Off (1-6). This sets the drive to be a single drive. Setting SW2 to Off On On Off Off Off makes it a slave drive. SW1 has been set to On Off Off On (1-4) all along.



MODEL      CYLINDERS   HEADS    SECTORS   CAPACITY (Million bytes)

M2622T      1013        10        63         326.75

M2624T      995         16        63         513.51


There are 6 switches on the switch block on these drives.  Only 4 of 
them have a use that I am aware of (from my M2624T manual):

Master/Slave        Master (*)      SW1-5 OFF
                    Slave           SW1-5 ON
ECC bytes           4 bytes (*)     SW1-4 OFF
                    7 bytes         SW1-4 ON
Write Protect       Disabled (*)    SW1-3 OFF
                    Enabled         SW1-3 ON
IO Channel Ready    Disabled (*)    SW1-1 OFF
                    Enabled         SW1-1 ON

I have no idea about the function of SW1-2 and SW1-6.  The values 
listed with a (*) are the factory default settings.

There are two sets of jumpers. A set of 5 and a set of
4. With the power and IDE connector toward you, the set of 5 is
numbered (left to right) J16 - J20  , and the set of 4 is numbered
(bottom to top) J22-J25. 

The only jumper of normal interest is J20. Jumper it for only
drive in a single drive system, or master drive in a dual drive
system.
 
Remove the jumper J20 for slave drive in a dual drive system. 

J19 is a dummy and may be used to store the spare shunt if the 
drive is configured for a slave mode.

Jumpers J17, J18, J24, J25 are factory reserved. Abnormal operation
may occur if jumpered.

Jumper 22 is sync spindle enabled/disabled  (open=disabled)
Jumper 23 is sync slave/master              (open=slave)
Jumper 16 is I/O Channel Ready              (open=disabled)

There have been reported difficulties in using WD Caviar as Master and
NEC drives as slave - the other way it works.

Link Options

   In order to install the Rodime Ro 3000A series drives the dumpers for 
the single/dual drive and LED operation on the drive need to be set as 
described in the relevant product specification.
   I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master.
   In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a
Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives 
when performing diagnostics.
   There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way 
interface connector. They have the following functions and are described 
in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper 
described nearest the 40 way interface connector.

LK2: LED 
     When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the
     interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An
     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with
     the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will
     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130
     Ohms ot 220 Ohms.

LK1: Dual Drives
     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single
     bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,
     indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.

LK4: Master
     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If
     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be
     jumpered in this way.

LK5: IOChRdy
     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is 
     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher
     data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per
     second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally 
     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per
     second.

   There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s)
may be jumpered:

     Master, single drive with LED on interface		LK2 & LK4 fitted.
     Master, single drive without LED on interface	LK4 only fitted.
     Master, dual drive without LED on interface	LK4 & LK1 fitted.
     Slave, dual drive without LED on interface		No jumpers fitted.
     Master, dual drive with LED on interface		LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.
     Slave, dual drive with LED on interface		LK2 only fitted.

   The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to
reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.

   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way 
connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected
by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the 
drive for this LED driver. Refer to the product specification for further
details.

Please note that these are the *recommended* CMOS parameters. All the disks 
support so-called dynamic translation, and should thus be able to work with
any parameters having fewer sectors than the total number of sectors on
the disk.

Now, according to the manual, the jumper settings are as follows:

Jumper                               CP   MA   SL
-------------------------------------------------
Single                                0    0    0
Master                                0    1    0
Slave                                 0    0    1
Slave with Conner CP342 or CP3022     1    0    1   


Maybe there are 2 kinds of Caviar's floating around: 

If your jumpers read MA SL and SI then use:
Jumper	SI	MA	SL
Single	1	0	0
Master	0	1	0
Slave	0	0	1

There have been reported difficulties in using WD Caviar as Master and
NEC drives as slave - the other way it works.
> When I installed a Conner CP3204F (203 MB) as master and a WD Caviar 2200
> (203 MB) as slave, both with and without the "CP" jumper, the Caviar had
> seemingly normal behaviour. However, when doing writes to the Caviar, once
> in a while it would overwrite directories etc. Using FASTBACK was almost

> The workaround is to install the Caviar as the master, and the Conner
> as the slave.
