   A program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the 
msdos/keyboard directory will do this.  It is written in assembler and it 
best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map.  It is possible, 
however, to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard 
driver if you do not have a compiler.  I used hexed100.zip, also available 
on simtel.  Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning 
of the "normal" keyboard map.  Then swap the codes for the keys that you 
wish to swap.  See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report 
the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).
Good luck,

- Pete
