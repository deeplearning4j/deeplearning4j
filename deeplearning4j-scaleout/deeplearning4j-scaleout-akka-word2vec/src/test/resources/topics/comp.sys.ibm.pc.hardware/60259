We had the same issue plague us for months on our Gateway.  I finally
got tired of it so I permanently interchanged the drives.  The only
reason I didn't do it in the first place was because I had several
bootable 5-1/4's and some 5-1/4 based install disks which expected
the A drive.  I order all new software (and upgrades) to be 3-1/2 and
the number of "stupid" install programs that can't handle an alternate
drive are declining with time - the ones I had are now upgraded.  And
as for the bootable 5-1/4's I just cut 3-1/2 replacements.

If switching the drives is not an option, you might be able to wire up
a drive switch to your computer chasis.  I haven't tried it but I think
it would work as long as it is wired carefully.
