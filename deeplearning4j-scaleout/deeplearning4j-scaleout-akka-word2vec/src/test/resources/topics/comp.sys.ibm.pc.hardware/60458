I agree that the image is as sharp as it gets with these SONY tubes,
however in the 17" monitors using these tubes, the 2 annoying black
lines on the top and bottom quarters of the tube, which are created due
to the wires holding up the Invar Shadow Mask, are quite annoying after
a while.  That is the only thing that is making me lean more in favor
of the NEC 5FG (or now also available the NEC 5FGe - only difference,
no ACCUCOLOR ).  Any experiences or opinions from people who have used
the NEC 5FG would be appreciated since I want to get one right after
my exams are all done (ie: about a week from now).
