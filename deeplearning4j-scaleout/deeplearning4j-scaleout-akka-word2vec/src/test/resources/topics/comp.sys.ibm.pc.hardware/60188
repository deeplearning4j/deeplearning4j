Subject: CACHE or Micronics EISA/VLB Motherboard?

This might be a silly question but I have to ask it anyway. I am in
the process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I
found two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the
same price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard (that's
the brand of the motherboard) with OPTI chip set, the other is Micron
(formerly Edge Technology) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB
motherboard.

I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that
Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never
heard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because
my impression is that they are known for building good, solid machines
and they have good tech support (24 hr, 7 days/wk), and a better
warrantee (2 years).  Micron, on the other hand, seems to have
recently aquired Edge Technologies and I'm not sure how much I should
trust the company.

I would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine the
clear choice?  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about
either company? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards? Should I
go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard? etc.

Thanks very much in advance for any information.
