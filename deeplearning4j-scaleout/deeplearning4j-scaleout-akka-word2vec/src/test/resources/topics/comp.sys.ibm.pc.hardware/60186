HI,
    Recently, when I run the Norton Disk surface test, I realize a slow
down in harddisk accessing.  At begining of the test, the harddisk will
be checked at the speed that usually is.  As the surface test scaned
half way through my harddisk, a tremendous slow down occured.  The
expected time for operation will jump from 3 to 6 minutes.  I try to use
some of the harddisk tools to check if there is any physical damage to
my harddisk and report always turn out to be none.  The surface test
only slow down for a certain section of the disk and turn back to the
original speed after it gets over the section.  I am wondering whether
it is a harddisk problem or some other problems. Anyway help or comment
will be appriciate....
