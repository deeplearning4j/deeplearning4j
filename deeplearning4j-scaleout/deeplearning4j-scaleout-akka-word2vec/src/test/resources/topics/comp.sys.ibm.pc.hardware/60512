Contrary to what others might have thought, I actually did have a SCSI drive
once.  It was the Seagate 296N and the ST-02 controller.  I found that the
controller couldn't keep up with a 1:1 interleave, so the best I could do
with the drive was a 2:1 interleave and a data transfer of about 450 k/sec.

I have had that drive/controller coexist with MFM, RLL, and IDE drives
because the ST-02 bios will kinda muscle itself in there with no help
needed from the computer's bios.  Dos will see many logical drives, much more
than 4 (I've had up to 10).  I've often wondered how many SCSI drives you
could hang off a ST-01/02.
