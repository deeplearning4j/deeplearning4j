Hi,

    I've just replaced my existing DTC SCSI controller with an Adaptec 1542B,
and am now having trouble restoring from a Jumbo 250 tape drive.

    I had no trouble installing the Adaptec and DOS recognises both the SCSI
drive and an existing IDE drive - however when I went to restore the backups
from the Jumbo tape I found that it was extremely slow (estimated time 3 mins
actual time 15 min!) I have no trouble restoring from the same tape to the IDE
drive.

    I seem to remember reading that some settings had to be changed to 
enable the Jumbo drive and the Adaptec to work together but I can't find any
mention of it in the manuals.

 My system config is:
   i486DX/33 4Mb 
   Adaptec 1542B running 180Mb Fujitsu SCSI
   IDE Controller running 200Mb IDE
   Jumbo 250 running off floppy controller on IDE

  Any help would be appreciated 

   Thanks,

   Ron. (ronaldm@extro.ucc.su.oz.au)
