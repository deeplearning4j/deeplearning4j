Does anybody out there have or used to have an HD controller from
Perstor System Inc. (which is out of business I believe)?  My friend
received an old PC which happens to have such a controller and I am
having a hard time trying to add another HD to the card.


I believe the controller is supposed to control MFM drives as RLL
drives?? 


Here the model info on the card, but any other similar model will
probably do.



Perstor System Inc.
Model: PS 180-16FN
Rev: 2.2 ECN 9-21


I would appreciate your reply directly to my e-mail address below.



Thanks,
