You realize, of course, that inevitably some anal retentive moron is
going to come along and wag his fingers and his jowls in outrage that
personal politics are more important than [SMCAP][BOLD][Font:God
999pt.]The Law[smcap][bold][font].

But that's irrelevant to the problem here.  Windows came with my
system, but on 5.25" disks.  I hate using 5.25" disks, so I copied
them over to high density 3.5"'s using xcopy.  It worked fine.  In
fact, for a while I was changing configurations and whatnot so much
that I decided to try putting them on the hard disk.  Not only can you
copy them over with one disk per directory, but if you want to, you
can simply copy them all into one directory.  Makes it a lot nicer
when you're switching printer emulations around.

Norton 6.0 I don't have much experience with, but when a friend's
system crashed, we restored from a backup rather than from the
originals, and it worked fine.  This would imply that arj a -r norton
c:\nu would create a workable backup, and if you did a full install
the first time, you've got the whole thing.

Never played with WP for Windows; I'm not too big of a fan of anything
from Utah.

Good luck....
