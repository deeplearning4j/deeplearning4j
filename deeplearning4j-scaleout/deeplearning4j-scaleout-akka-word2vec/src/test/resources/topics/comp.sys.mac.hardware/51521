I recently purchased a Centris 610 and am having difficulty getting
my computer to recognize my hard disk drive (external) Using both the
disk uitily of TMS (Diskwriter) and Jasmine's software, neither one
will show the drive.  The drive is the only device connected to the 
scuzzi port. I cant find the manual to the tms pro 120 and seem to
remember that it is "terminated".  Is there something else that I am
doing (or not doing) that does not allow my 610 to recognize my external
disk drive?.

thanks in advance for the information.
