I have a chance to buy a used PS/2 Appletalk card to create a network with
my home machines.  However, the guy who has the card tells me there's a
DB-9 or DB-15 (can't remember now) on the back of the card, rather than
the 8-pin (or 4-pin) mini-din that I expect.  This sounds more like a
Thicknet ethernet card.  Should there be a transciever on it, like on the
Quadras?  What would be a reasonable price to expect to pay for one of
these cards, keeping in mind that it's Micro-Channel Architecture, which
means take your best guess and double it.
Email replies would be appreciated, to here or to rrr@ideas.com
Thanks.
