Hi there,


I have a question regarding Quadras VRAM. I have tried to find info on this
but I could not get precise answers.

On one hand, we have a Quadra 950 with a 16" monitor, which is capable of
32-bit color. How much VRAM does it have?
On the other hand, we have a Quadra 800 with a 16" monitor, which is capable
of 8-bit color only, so it must have 512 Ko of VRAM.

I would like to take VRAM SIMMs for the 950 and put them in the 800 so that
both machines have 16-bit color capability.
Is it possible, and if yes, how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the 950?
From the documentation I have, the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have
16-bit color, is that correct?

Bonus question: where do VRAM SIMMs hide? From the 950 documentation, they
seem to be *behind* the power supply. Do I really have to take off the power
supply to access the VRAM SIMMs?


Thanks for your help!
