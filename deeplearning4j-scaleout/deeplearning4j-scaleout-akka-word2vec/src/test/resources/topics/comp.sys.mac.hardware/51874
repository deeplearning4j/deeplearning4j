Subject: Word Printing to IIg

We have a user that has Word 5.0 and is using symbols such as pi and
other mathematic sysmbols, plus doing fractions, etc.

The document shows up on the screen with no problems, looks fine.

When she tries to print it on a IIg the pi changes to an upside down
caret, and several other symbols change to double quotes at bottom of
character, plus some little circles appear between words of the fractions
instead of spaces.

This happens on a IIg laser printer.  Tried it on serveral macs and two
different IIg's.

Prints fine on an NT and NTX laser printers.

What's wrong???

Thanks for any help in advance,

Gary
