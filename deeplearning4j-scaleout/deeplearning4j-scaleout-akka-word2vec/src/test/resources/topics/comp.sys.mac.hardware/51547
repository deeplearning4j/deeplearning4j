Yea, thanks to lots of good information in this newsgroup, I was prepared
for lots of details (even shipping time ... got my C610 8/230/CD in 5 weeks).
I guess my biggest disappointment is the lack of detail in the written
specs and documentation.  The case load spec is an example -- the setup
section says Apple 14" and 16" monitors can go on top, but 21" and other
big ones can't.  Why couldn't they publish a maximum load?

Now if I can figure out if there's any hope using the "partition" button
on the hard disk setup utility (do I dare just try it and see what happens?),
then maybe I can divide up the wealth among the family members a bit more
securly.  The "getting more information" section of the manual suggested
trying other avenues before calling Apple, but didn't mention the net.
