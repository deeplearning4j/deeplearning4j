Gosh, I wish people would read the postings that they are 'following up' to.

The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new
wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print
GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer
(and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not
possible).

This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to
Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It
is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.

SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour
version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the
'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it
gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).

There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older
computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been
upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal
with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult 
time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).

Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT
Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to
do so, whatever Mac you were using. (And I am pretty sure that the Select 300
is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [? correct me if I'm wrong?]).
