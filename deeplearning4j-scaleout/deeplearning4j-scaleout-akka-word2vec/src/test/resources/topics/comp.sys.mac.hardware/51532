I've had a couple of e-mail responses from people who seem to believe that
this sort of thing is not only unsupported, it is downright dangerous.

I have heard of no such warnings from anybody at Apple. Just to be sure, I
asked a couple of our technicians, one of whom has been servicing Macs for
years. There is *no* danger of damaging logic boards by plugging and unplugging
ADB devices with the power on.

SCSI, yes, ADB, no...
