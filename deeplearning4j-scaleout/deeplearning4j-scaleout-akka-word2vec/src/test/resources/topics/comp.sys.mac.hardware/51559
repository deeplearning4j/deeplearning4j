No, he's not missing anything.  You're right that some models of the 650 ship in
the USA without FPU or Ethernet.  Per Ejeklint is also right -- *all*, I repeat,
*ALL* Centris 650's sold here in New Zealand and, I assume, Europe have the FPU

I know.  I bought a 650 4/80 and it has both FPU and Ethernet.
