I have had my Q700 running with a 66.666 MHz osc for a few months. I have a
number of SCSI devices connected (Quantum LP52, Maxtor 213, Toshiba MK156F via
Emulex adapter, Pioneer DRM-600) and have had no trouble.

I am using the stock cooling facilities, I considered adding a fan/heat pump,
but don't feel they are necessary (for my box anyway). I have a temp meter on
order and plan to do some measurements when it arrives in a few weeks. Email me
if you want to see the results.
