This problem is most likely the same that all cx users are experiencing....
Thanks to one very adventurous USENET reader (sorry I can't remember the
guy's name!  Somebody please post it....he deserves the credit for saving
us all $$$$$) it is easily fixed, if it is the same problem......


Best I can figure it is due to time, heat and repeated warmup/cool downs in
the power supply....i.e., bad solder joints in the power supply circuit
card.  Go get a desolder tool from radio shack, a low wattage iron and some
good nonacid solder and resolder the lower left quadrant of the circuit
card with the AC plugs facing away from you..........or get someone to do
it for you.  It took me less then 10 minutes and saved me at least $300 for
a new supply!
