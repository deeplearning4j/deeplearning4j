I'm in the market for a laser printer. Used printers are fine, non-apple
printers are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:

Required features:

- PostScript

- 300 dpi

- emough memory to download fonts

- The cheaper, the better.  I'd prefer under $1000.


Nice things:

- anything over 4 pages per minute

- scsi output for a font disk

- smallish footprint



Don't Care About:

- PostScript Level II

- networking (its just for me, and always will be)

- color


I know about Freedom of Press, but I've also heard that its painfully slow.
I can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I'm not going
to consider the price savings worth it.  I'd be curious to hear people's
experience with it, tho. 

I also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in
my last job and wasn't impressed with the quality.  I'm a laser bigot
and the first to admit it. :)


I'll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I'm writing.  The
page will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and
maybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn't need to
be spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.


Printers I've been looking at:


- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that
  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?

- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee
  discount (I work for one of Apple's spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably
  cheaply.  I've heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I'm leaning
  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.

- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn't have PostScript, but I haven't
  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."
  ??

- Used HP LaserJets.  I've worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and
  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?

- I've seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.
  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),
  but if its a decent printer I'll consider it.


Thanks for any comments...
