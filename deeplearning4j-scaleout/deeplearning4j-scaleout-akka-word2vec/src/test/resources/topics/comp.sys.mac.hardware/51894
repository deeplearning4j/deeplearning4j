hat the Megadrives worked perfectly on both myMac Plus and my Powerbook 140.  It was for this reason I assumedthe problem had something to do with the Quadra.  Even with theQuadra, they mostly worked OK.  The problem occurred when I ejecteda cartridge from a drive: it would start popping up dialog boxessaying "This cartridge must be formatted with Jasmine Driveware"even though there was no cartridge in the drive.	--Mark
t to format) I have this confirmed from Apple Computer in Sweden (I work for a Apple dealer as a service tech). We had problems that Quadras wanted to format a diskette or a Syquest when ther was nothing in the drive. This problem was fixed sytem 7.1Mikael Fredriksson-------------------------------------------------email: mikael_fredriksson@macexchange.seMac Exchange BBSPL 3813S-437 92 LindomeSwedenBBS +46-31-948290 (5 lines)FAX +46-31-948294FIDO 2:203/211
