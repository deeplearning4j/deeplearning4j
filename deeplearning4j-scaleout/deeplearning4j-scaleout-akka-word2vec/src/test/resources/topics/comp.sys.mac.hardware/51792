Their should be no difference in the drive itself between IBM-PC and Mac.
The two main differences are the formatting of the disk itself (but with
the correct software each can read the others) and maybe the cable
(depends on your SCSI board on IBM-PC).

If you get some Mac softawre to allow mounting of ANY IBM-formatted disk
and the correct cable you should br able to mount and read your IBM-PC
syquest.

good luck,
