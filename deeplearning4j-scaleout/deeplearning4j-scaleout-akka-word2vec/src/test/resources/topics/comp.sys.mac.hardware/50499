Well, although this may be an uncommon occurrence (or not) I had a "bad"
experience with TechWorks.  This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in
a powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was
told by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return
the original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for
returning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.

Well, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were
ever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me "Why we never
received your old chips."  I then explained I the procedure that I had
followed to return them, to which the person replied "You mean you sent them
US Mail?" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was
told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that
I should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly
what I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were
absolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted
to trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to
TechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.)
Sales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them
to "make it right."

I finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking
them to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously
appeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with
the service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way of
knowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengths
to prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c'est la vie.  I will never
buy another product from them again.

(There - had to get that off my chest!)
