A week or so ago, I posted about a problem with my SE/30:  I have 20 megs
or true RAM, yet if I set my extensions to use a large amount of memory
(total of all extensions) then my system will crash before the finder
comes up.  What I meant was having a large amount of fonts load, or
sounds, or huge disk caches with a control panel other than Apple's
memory control panel.  Apple's cache is at 64K, mode 32 is on, and
so is 32 bit addressing.  All extensions work by themselves or with the
others until I increase the memory used by some of them (with methods
mentioned above).

Well, here's my latest followup...  I ran NOWs System Profile and got
this information:

%%% Memory info %%%

Physical RAM size: 20480K.
Logical RAM size: 20480K.
Size of Low Memory Area: 8K.
Virtual Memory: Inactive.
Addressing mode: 32bit mode in use.
32 bit System zone: Absent.
Parity RAM: Not capable.
Growable System Heap: True.
Temporary memory support: Present.
Tempory Memory Support: Real and tracked.

Note that 32 bit System zone is absent.  Could this be the problem?
How can I turn this on?  Any ideas?

Can anyone help?
