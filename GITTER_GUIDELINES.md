# Gitter Guidelines

Many of the questions that asked on Gitter can be answered elsewhere. To respect the Skymind team's time, Deeplearning4j users are asked to remember a few things:

1. Use Google before you ask a question. The Gitter channel should not be used as a human-enhanced search engine. 
2. If you don't receive an immediate response, please post again and flag your question with the Gitter ID of one of the people in the channel answering questions. If you do receive a response and link, spend some time reading and trying to understand the response and additional resources before you keep asking that question. 
3. We're not perfect, and neither is our documentation. If you find ways for us to improve, please email us at help@skymind.io and let us know what we need to fix.
