Some say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result of
the coalescence of billions of tons of interstellar debris.  In either case,
the property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years.

Oh?  When did She *stop*?  Mother Nature has been automatically providing
us with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze.  It
is not "produced": it produces itself, year after year.  Last night, for
example, I saw four deer crossing the road (pretty sight, too); in an
earlier time, one of them would have been dinner.

The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often
freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and
clothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their
Polynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared
many things with the other Islanders.  In fact, "hi'ipoi", the Hawaiian
word for "cherish" means "sharing food".  The Great Mahele, in which
the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and
the poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will often
share tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village
and neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to
Africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so-
called "theft" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which,
until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.

These are the people we call "savages".

On the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.

Dov, before you make further comment on this thread, I think it would
behoove you to study *all* of the facts.
