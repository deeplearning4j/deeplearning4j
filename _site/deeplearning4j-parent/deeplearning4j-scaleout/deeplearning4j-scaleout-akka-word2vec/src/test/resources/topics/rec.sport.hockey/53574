	Here is an update on the Goalie mask poll...
	First, since so many people gave me their 3 best, I decided to
give 3 pts for their favorite, 2 pts for 2nd, 1 for 3rd. If you e-mailed
a response with only one, I gave it 3 pts. Please feel free to send me
your 2 other favorites, if you only sent one before. 
	Also, votes are still welcome! Any mask you like will do, as I 
have received votes for players not in the NHL. Please mention what team
they play for, though.
	So here are the up-to-date results so far:

Player                 Team              Pts     Votes
