After a rough start purchasing a 486 system (see earlier post), I'm trying
again.  I'm looking at the following system offered by EPS Technologies:

- 486dx 33mhz w/ 256K static RAM cache,AMI Bios
- 3 32-bit VESA local bus slots, 3 16-bit slots, 1 8-bit slot
- Teac 1.2 & 1.44 mb floppy drives
- Maxtor 170 MB hard drive (15 ms) IDE w/64K cache buffer
- 32-bit vesa local bus video card w/ 1mb RAM 1024 X 768 NI (I *think* it's an
   Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 card)
- 14" NI Multisync monitor 1024 X 768
- 101 Keyboard
- 200 Watt power supply
- Windows 3.1, Mouse, DOS 6.0
- *3* years limited warranty
- 1 year on-site service

I'm probably going to add the $125 for a 15" flat-screen digital monitor, and
will also want to go for at least 8 mb RAM ($159 extra).

Has anyone bought from EPS Technologies, particularly a system like the one
I'm considering.  I'm especially interested in their warrantee and service.
Can anyone recommend other companies who offer similar packages, with support,
and comparable prices (I see FastMicro just bit it...).
Thanks in advance,
