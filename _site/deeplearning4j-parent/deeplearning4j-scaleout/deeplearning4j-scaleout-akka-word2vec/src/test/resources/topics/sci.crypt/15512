  But, if you are making custom equipment in any case, why not just
roll your own Clipper implementation and report the wrong keys to the
Escrow agency?  (Tells us who is going to be in the chip business if
this thing goes through--NSA, and those with something to hide from
NSA.)

  If anyone can verify that your phone is not using the key registered
to that serial number, either:

  1) They have a court ordered wiretap.  But what are they going to
do?  Tell the judge that this individual really does have privacy?
All they know is that the keys are not enough, but not why.

  2) They have a court ordered wiretap on a phone in this series.
(This part is really scary.  Since the "expectation" is that all
chips in a particular batch will uses seeds based on the same S1 and
S2 and the serial number, getting the keys for one of a batch may give
access to all.)

  3) There is a backdoor which allows all messages to be deciphered
without the keys.  I find this one especially threatening since the
scheme seems very open to known plaintext attacks.  (What I need to
decipher is the data in the header.  If I talk to someone who has one
of these phones, presumably there will be an automatically negotiated
key generated.  I'm not trying to decipher the record of the
conversation to know what was said, I use it as a known plaintext to
recover the backdoor represented by the header, but I know what the
header says for conversations I participate in.  Even worse, if the
phones in a series have related keys, I can buy a phone/chip from the
same production lot.  Then I can recover its keys, either elegantly by
talking to myself, or by brute force analysis of the actual chip, then
apply the key generation process with those seeds to find the target
keys.)

    Hmmm!  I don't think I want to ever come close to these phones.
Even DES is starting to look good.  Two cans and a string will provide
much better security.
