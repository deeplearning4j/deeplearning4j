Firstly, I am an atheist. I am not posting here as an immature flame
start, but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience.

The meaning of my existence is a question I ask myself daily.  I live 
in fear of what will happen when I  die.   

I bet some of you are licking your lips now, because you think that
I'm a person on the edge of accepting jeezus.             

I was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years of
religious educational institutions..  I know the bible well. So well
I can recognize many passages from memory.  

<<****Strong opinions start here...****>>

1) The human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced
mental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to
explain the unexplainable.  (For example the ancient Greeks believed
that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  Due
to the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.  

Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are 
because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life
a safety blanked to hide behind.  "Oh wow..all i have to do is 
follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness."
For all of you "found jeezus" , how many of you were "on the brink?"

but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its
infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian
group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which
basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.


We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we
die.      

Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG.
Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject
themselves with jeezus and live with that high. 

It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious
wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.

When Christians see a "non-believer", they say that person is blind
to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live
with this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet #37696 
who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans
were (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities
needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time
of dire need.

I must go.  These are but a few of my thoughts on Christianity.
