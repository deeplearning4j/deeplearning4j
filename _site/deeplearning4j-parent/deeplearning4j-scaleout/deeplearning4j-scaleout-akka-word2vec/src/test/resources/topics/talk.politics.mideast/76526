Dorin, of all the criticism of my post expressed on t.p.m., this one I accept.
I regret that aspect of my post. It is my hope that the occupation will end (and
the accompanying loss of life) but I believe that stiff resistance can help to 
achieve that end. Despite what some have said on t.p.m., I think that there is 
a point when losses are unacceptable. The strategy drove U.S. troops out of 
Lebanon, at least.
