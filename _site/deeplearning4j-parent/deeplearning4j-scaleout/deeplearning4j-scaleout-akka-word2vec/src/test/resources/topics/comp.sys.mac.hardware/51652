  Actually, an accelerator such as the Daystar 33 MHz 68040 is cheaper than
upgrading to a Q700 (25 MHz).  The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas
the upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700
upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21"
with 8 bit depth and up to 16" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It
also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which
makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.

  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're
better off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an
accelerator.
