Can you provide some evidence that the slave states regarded slaves as
not humans?  They were "outside our society" and similar phrases that
basically meant that they didn't have to recognized as having the same
rights as a free person, but they were never considered "not human" to
my knowledge.

If that were the case, the slave states would not have passed so many
laws that restricted the freedom of slave owners to do as they wished
with their property.  Examples: laws prohibiting manumission without
legislative grant; laws prohibiting teaching slaves to read & write.
