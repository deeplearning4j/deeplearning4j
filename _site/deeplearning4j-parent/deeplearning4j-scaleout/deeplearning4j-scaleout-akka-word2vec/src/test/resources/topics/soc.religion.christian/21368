1 Cor 11:31-32 "But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. 
When we are judged by the ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^ Lord, we are being discipled so
that we will not be condemned with the world."

1 Cor 5:3 "Even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit.
And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this, just as if I were
present."          ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^

1 Cor 2:15-16 "The spiritual man makes judgments about all things, but he
himself is not     ^^^^^^^^^ subject to any man's      ^^^ judgement:  'For
who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him?'  But we have the
mind of Christ."

Jude :14-15 "Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men:  'See,
the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge
everyone, and to   ^^^^ convict all the ungodly of  ^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^ ^^ ^^^^^ all
the ungodly acts they have done in the ungodly way, and of all the harsh words
ungodly sinners have spoken against him.'"

Arrogance is a sin.  Although a desire to show others of one's rightness may
be a sign of arrogance in some cases,  it may be only a sign that they are
following the Bible in others:

Jude :22-23 "Be merciful to those who doubt; snatch others from the fire and
save them; to others show mercy, mixed with  ^^^^^^ fear -- hating  ^^^^ even
^^^^ the clothing stained by corrupted flesh."


>If I find someone arrogant, I typically don't have anything to do with them.  

I hope you don't find me arrogant, then.  This sounds like a bad practice --
ignoring what certain people say because you perceive them as arrogant.

James 1:19 "My dear brothers, take note of this:  Everyone should be quick to
listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry,"
