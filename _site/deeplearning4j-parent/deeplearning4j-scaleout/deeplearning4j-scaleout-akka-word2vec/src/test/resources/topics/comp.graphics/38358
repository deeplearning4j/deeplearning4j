It's really not that hard to do.  There are books out there which explain
everything, and the basic 3D functions, translation, rotation, shading, and
hidden line removal are pretty easy.  I wrote a program in a few weeks witht
he help of a book, and would be happy to give you my source.
	Also, Quickdraw has a lot of 3D functions built in, and Think pascal
can access them, and I would expect that THINK C could as well.  If you can
find out how to use the Quickdraw graphics library, it would be an excellent
choice, since it has a lot of stuff, and is built into the Mac, so should be
fast.
