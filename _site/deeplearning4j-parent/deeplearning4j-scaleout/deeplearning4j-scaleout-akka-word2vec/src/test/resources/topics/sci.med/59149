   Many of these cereals are corn-based. After your post I looked in the
   literature and located two articles that implicated corn (contains
   tryptophan) and seizures. The idea is that corn in the diet might
   potentiate an already existing or latent seizure disorder, not cause it.
   Check to see if the two Kellog cereals are corn based. I'd be interested.

A couple of folks have suggested the "corn connection".  In the five month
period between the two seizures, my daughter had eaten a fair amount of
Kix and Berry Berry Kix in the mornings and never had a problem.  I checked
the labels and the first ingredient is corn.  She has also never had a problem
eating corn or corn on the cob but of course, that is usually later in the day
with a full stomach so the absorption would not be so high.  I do believe that
Frost Flakes have corn in them but I will have to check the Fruit Loops.  But
the fact that she has eaten this other corny cereal in the morning makes me
wonder.

Thanks for checking into this.  All information at this point is valuable to me.
