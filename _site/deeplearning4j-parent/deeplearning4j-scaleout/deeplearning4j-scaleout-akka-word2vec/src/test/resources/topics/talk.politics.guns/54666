Still mastering the language, eh?  Notice the use of "apparently".

I'm not denying that at all.  But every day is another chance for a good  
ending, why push it?  Mr. Roby, you are going to die, anyway, why not today?   
Every moment of life is precious.

No, you are the heartless "bleeding heart".  A flaming liberal who "cares  
deeply", who "feels your pain".

You have continually raised this issue, without any understanding of the bonds  
between parent and child.  It is not easy to say a final goodbye to your  
children, I do not think I could do it, either.  If that makes me heartless, so  
be it.  How many children do you have?  I have three.

It just makes me sad.  I never claimed Koresh was an angel.

I made the same authority worshiper point about you a few lines back.  And once  
again, Jonestown, however sick it was, was doing OK, until "the Authorities"  
showed up and pushed a fragile person over the edge.  

A bull in a china shop.

Nope, the constitution in total is, for me.  If you think the RKBA is all I'm  
about, you misjudge me.
