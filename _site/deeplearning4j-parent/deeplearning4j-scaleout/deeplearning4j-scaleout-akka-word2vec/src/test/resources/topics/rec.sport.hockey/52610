I'll have to disagree with you on this one. I think Vancouver will go as
Bure goes, and if he continues on his goal scoring slump, then they
won't even make it out of the first round. I think the Kings will make
it out of the first round, regardless of who they play. They seem to be
doing pretty well, even with that bad game against Minnesota on
Saturday. I think it'll be either Calgary or Los Angeles to win the
Smythe (i.e. go on to the conference finals).

Still have to disagree with you here. I think it'll be Pittsburg to
get the hat trick in Stanley Cups. They just look
toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good.

Neither do I. Well, may the best team win it all (Pittsburg). That's
just my $.02 worth.
