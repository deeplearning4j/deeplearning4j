   Greetings!

	   Situation:  I have a phone jack mounted on a wall.  I don't
		       know the number of the line.  And I don't want
		       to call up the operator to place a trace on it.

	   Question:   Is there a certain device out there that I can
		       use to find out the number to the line?
	   Thanks for any response.
						       Al
