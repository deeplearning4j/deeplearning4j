My little Nash has sat for about a year (had been running), but now I must move
a long distance and there are too many things to carry with me.  Here are the
details of the car:

1958 Hardtop--Exterior condition:
     Rocker panels rusted out at weld points, no rust at typical spots like
     door hinge mounting points, back battery box, etc.  Missing front bumper,
     front pan dented up, one weld popped in front.  This is for the most part
     a solid, restorable automobile.

     Interior Condition:
     Missing original steering wheel, has one of the smaller aftermarket
     wheels, seats need reupholstered, general fair condition.

     Mechanical Condition:
     Had been running, but now does not want to start...needs new rings (which
     I have) also have extra parts such as complete long block, extra steering
     shaft, etc.

For a car that has not been touched since 1958, it is in solid shape.  It will
obviously need some work, but will make a good project.

PRICE:  Well, this is a tough one, I would like to get around 800.00, but will
consider any serious offers by individuals willing to come and get it. If you 
have things to trade such as tools, toys, cameras, comics, cards, etc., 
anything easily movable to Florida, I may consider that as well.
