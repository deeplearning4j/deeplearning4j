How would you deal with Arabs who ALWAYS threaten to drive you into the sea or
burn half your conuntry?  Would you talk nicely?  Would you say please?  You
wouldn't.  The language of the middle east is power and force.  Sorry - that
is the way it is now.  If you aren't strong, you go down.  Israel has to talk 
and act tough.  Notice, Israel talks and acts tough in battle, but is willing
to talk peace.

True - and they have brainwashed their people into thinking Jews are some sort
of monsters.  Arab non-recognition of Israel and support of war and terror
is also an important factor, wouldn't you say?

What do you want Israel to do?  They are negotating? I'm sick of people calling
for Israel to withdraw from the territories now.  That's not realistic, don't
you realize that?  A solution must be negotiated.  It is on the table.  Have
patience.
