I have been using a NEC 3FGx for several months now.  Several others here 
also have this monitor.  We have had no problems.  Personally I would spend 
extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33 
MHz viz 50 Mhz.  Based on the comments of others you might want to view the 
3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate 
appears ok for me, but you might feel differently.  Finally speaking of 
spending money, with the size of today's files, etc, a tape backup is 
certainly worth $200-$300.  Recently I set up a friend's PC 50Mhz and VESA 
local bus.  The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2 
faster which I doubt warrants the extra cost.
