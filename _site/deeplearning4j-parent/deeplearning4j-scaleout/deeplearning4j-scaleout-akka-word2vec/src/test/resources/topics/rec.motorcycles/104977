Like most everyone else, I ended up getting two different sizes for
the top and bottom.  My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the
bottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the
46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have
large, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get
them :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the
waist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece
size that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's
problems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and
when I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).

I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are
in some way different from us real folks.

Also, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn
wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands.
I've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a
store wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom
in any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my
sidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally
leave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall
down unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight),
stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit),
and run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be
running errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...

As far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably
equal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece
provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by
3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around
the waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.

So I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit,
I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I
own.  Wouldn't go long distance without it.
