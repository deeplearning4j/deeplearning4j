Actually I wasn't too surprised, since I bought it with the rust.  Any of you 
got some ideas of getting rid of this CHEAPLY (key word)??  It has eaten all 
the
way through on the door panels.  Can I use Bondo?  
 
Also, is there a good paint that will bond to Aluminum rims?  The paint thati
was on my rims has peeled off, actually, there's some rust looking 'stuff' on
the rims themselves...  but it comes off pretty easily.  
 
One more thing...
Have any of you done self-painting to a car?  How do you start?  What do I need
to do this?
 
Please help me!
Jesse
