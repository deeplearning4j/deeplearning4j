  Alomar fans left RBI fans and Runs off this list because they are dependant
on the team. (To a large extent). If Frank Thomas hit first, he'd lose a LOT
of RBI's; and anyways how many 2nd place hitters have you known to drive
in 100 runs? Doesn't happen that often.....very unlikely with Devon White's
~.300 OBP in front of you...
