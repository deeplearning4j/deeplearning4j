You do not need the SDK. What you need (and can get free) are

Location: ftp.cica.indiana.edu
index:      /pub/pc/win3/INDEX

First get /pub/pc/win3/uploads/what.zip (~1.3M) This contains the help
compiler among other things. It is free from Microsoft.

Then get these (I think these are free too)

dir:	/pub/pc/win3/programr
files:  hag.zip, whag.zip wfwhlp.zip

These are shareware

dir:    /pub/pc/win3/util
files:	hwab21.zip, qdhelp.zip, qdtool.zip

dir:	/pub/pc/win3/winword
files:	drhelpev.zip (macros for word 2.0 to convert doc to hlp files).
