I was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work, and I have the option
of adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine.  The
existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well, and is working fine,
but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave
relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup.

The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually
going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0

The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991
They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact
configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a
setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone).
There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are
for setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machine
had none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the
back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.

When booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does
flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.  
Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not
being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, I
would not even know how to do that.

Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  If not, a number
for Western Digital might just do as good!
