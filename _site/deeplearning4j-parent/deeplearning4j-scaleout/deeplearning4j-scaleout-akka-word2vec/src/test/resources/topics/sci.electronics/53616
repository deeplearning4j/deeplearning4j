Not even in sub panels!  The only place the neutral should be connected to the
ground is in a SERVICE DISCONNECT!  In your house the "main" panel serves as
the service disconnect.  Sub panles in your garage or workshop for example must
maintain seperate neutral and ground busses because they are not  service
disconnect equipment.
