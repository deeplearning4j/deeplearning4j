  I saw the following computer in a store and wanted to know if this is a good
computer or does someone see something wrong with it.  I also would like to
switch the motherboard later when this computer becomes too slow.  Does anyone
know if this is possible with a Leading Edge Computer, or will it be difficult
to find a motherboard that will fit in this computer.  Any help will be
greatly appreciated.
