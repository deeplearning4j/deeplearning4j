But what was wrong with it?  It won't tempt anyone to any kind of sin, as
far as I can tell.  It doesn't belittle anyone.  It does not substitute
offensiveness for humor (it's genuinely funny).

We shouldn't assume that _all_ jokes that mention sexuality are "dirty"
merely because so many are.

And we should never mistake prudery for spirituality.  It can be the direct
opposite -- a symptom of the _lack_ of a healthy perspective on God's
creation.
