Some people pay shares that are more "fair" than others, and will continue
to do so, even with the presence of President Clinton.  Until the rich 
elite *hurt* from taxes and shower me with their blood dripping from the
wound of the tax dagger, I will scream and yell.  Because, taxes are 
killing the poor and middle-class, and I'm tired of the wealthy getting
a free ride in this country.  Sure, they pay a lot of taxes, but I want
them to SHARE MY PAIN!!

And, not even Slick Willy is *that* fair, is he, seeing that he and his
wife qualify as one of those wealthy people I was talking about?  [They're
on the lower end of "wealthy", but "wealthy" they are.]

Yah, I think the draft for Vietnam was a sack of shit.  But, do we get
to pick and choose which laws we obey, Mr. Chaudhary?  If so, shall we
set up a "you follow the laws you like, and I'll follow the laws I 
like" arrangement?

>6.   Hey, I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60's-esque touch!

I never thought much of beaded curtains.
 
Now beaded seat-covers, on the other hand....

>5.   [Health care is a human right--deleted]

I didn't think I was going to respond to this, but I changed my mind.

Tell me, why do you think health care is a human right?  

This isn't a flame or anything, I just wonder.  Next thing you know, 
free public transportation will be a human right.  Maybe membership
at prestigious health spas?

[Sorry to grease the hill on ya there....]

>4.   Make love, not War!

Be sure and wrap that wanker when you go spreadin' that free love stuff
around.  (Or, after the FDA gets its thumb out of its ass, use that neat
new "Reality" femi-condom.)

So do I.  Amen.  And all that.

>1.   HEY MAN, ACADAMIA RULES!!

What the hell is an "acadamia" anyway?  Is that like a macadamia?

Slick Willy's already got his hand in my pocket.  I'm just afraid
of what he might grab hold of.
