Frankly, I think this model is a screwup.  It does not have PostScriptlevel
2, only has 13 fonts, and does not even have  fine print or photograde, or
grayshare.  Even the 300 model has this!  I am shocked by the kind of
features you get for this printer.  I myself was hoping for some decent
printer to replace the Personal Laser Writers.
