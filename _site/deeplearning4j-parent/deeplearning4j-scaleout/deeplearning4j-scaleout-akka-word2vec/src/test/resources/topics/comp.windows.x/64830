XGOALS OF THE CONTEST:
X
X    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.
X    * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code.
X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-)
X
X
XRULES:
X
X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules:
X
X    1) Your entry must be a complete program.
X
X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters
X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or }
X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.
X
X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:
X
X---entry---
Xrule:	1993
Xfix:	y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)
Xtitle:	title of entry  		    (see comments below)
Xentry:	Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)
Xdate:	Date/time of submission in UTC	    (see comments below)
Xhost:	Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested
X	Use tab indented lines if needed
X---remark---
X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if
X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a
X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th
X    column.  Blank lines are permitted.
X---author---
Xname:	your name
Xorg:	School/Company/Organization
Xaddr:	postal address
X	use tab indented lines to continue
X	don't forget to include the country
Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.
X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.
Xanon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)
X---info---
XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in
Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info
Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.
X---build---
XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program
Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting
Xfile must be 255 bytes or less.
X---program---
XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode
Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.
X---end---
X
X      Regarding the above format:
X
X	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*
X	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.
X
X	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should
X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,
X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.
X
X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect
X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() 
X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)
X
X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending
X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the 
X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same 
X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be 
X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.
X
X	* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above 
X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges
X	  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate
X	  Email message to the judges.
X
X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless 
X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.
X
X	* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for
X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and
X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.
X
X	* The entry's remarks should include:
X	    - what this program does
X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input)
X	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any
X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)
X	    - information about any ---data--- files
X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated
X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.
X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)
X
X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain
X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.
X
X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They 
X	  should not be required to exist.
X
X	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---
X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple 
X	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe
X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:
X
X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed
X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional
X	       digit, followed by '.c'
X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's
X	       title, possibly followed by a digit
X
X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your
X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a
X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of
X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed
X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.
X
X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must
X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.
X
X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be
X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,
X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this
X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.
X
X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.
X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not 
X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the
X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.
X
X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is
X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:
X
X		...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate
X		obfuscate@toad.com
X
X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.
X
X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries
X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however.
X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for
X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.
X
X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry
X       must be sent in a separate Email letter.
X
X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.  
X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed.
X
X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user,
X       special owner or group) are not allowed.
X

X10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest Guidelines, Hints and Comments
X

XAll Rights Reserved.  Permission for personal, education or non-profit use is

X
XABOUT THIS FILE:
X
X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).
X
X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about
X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.
X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.
X
X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.
X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.
X
X
XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:
X
X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c
X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.
X
X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C
X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers 
X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with 
X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor 
X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.
X
X
XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:
X
X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See
X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.
X
X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries
X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year
X    might be 'old' the next year.
X
X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply
X    a number of tests to an entry:
X
X	* look at the original source
X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII
X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines
X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines
X	* run it through a C beautifier
X	* examine the algorithm
X	* lint it
X	* compile it
X	* execute it
X
X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.
X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.
X
X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain
X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the
X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as
X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given
X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that
X    does something interesting when you run it.
X
X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave
X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life
X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the
X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.
X
X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know
X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse
X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the
X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to
X    annoy more than amuse.
X
X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries
X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use
X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)
X
X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make
X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly
X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some
X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.
X
X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that
X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off
X    documenting it.  Noting "this entry sometimes prints the 4th power
X    of a prime by mistake" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,
X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly
X    working entry is best.
X
X
XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:
X
X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We
X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests
X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far
X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.
X
X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:
X
X	#define d define
X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo
X
X	int i;
X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration
X	int k;
X
X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you 
X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in 
X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.
X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:
X
X	int i;
X	char *c;
X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead
X	(i+3)["string"];   <--- use "string"[i+3] instead
X
X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of
X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety
X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are
X    not portable and must not be used:
X
X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable
X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable
X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg
X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg
X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables
X	* using va_list as a structure or union
X
X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.
X
X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.
X
X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),
X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some
X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.
X
X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries
X    must not assume that it returns an int.
X
X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.
X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do
X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people
X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for
X    programs that are compact, and are instructional.
X
X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80
X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.
X
X    We tend to dislike programs that:
X
X	* are very hardware specific
X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific
X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific
X	      code is likely not to be)
X	* dump core or have compiler warnings
X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)
X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x
X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit
X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs
X	* are longer than they need to be
X	* are similar to previous winners
X	* are identical to previous losers  :-)
X
X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the
X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program
X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.
X
X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size
X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,
X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to
X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel
X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off
X    if you show some amount of restraint.
X
X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact
X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get
X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.
X
X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob
X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C
X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third
X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!
X
X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'
X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating
X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.
X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)
X    know of a smaller one!
X
X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that
X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't
X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend
X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.
X
X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and
X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client
X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the
X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).
X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone
X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not
X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or
X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better
X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.
X
X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on
X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines
X    in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    We like programs that:
X
X	* are as concise and small as they need to be
X	* do something at least quasi-interesting
X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)
X	* are portable
X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION
X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)
X
X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your
X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several
X    areas really does help.
X
X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in
X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to
X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.
X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.
X
X    Be creative!
X
X
XENTRY FORMAT:
X
X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your
X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,
X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the
X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)
X
X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to
X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that
X    is found in mkentry.c:
X
X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every
X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,
X	where this program differs from the contest rules, the
X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the
X	contest rules before submitting an entry.
X
X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,
X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check
X    the entry against the size rules.
X
X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about
X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below)
X
X    The following is a sample entry:
X
X---entry---
Xrule:	1993
Xfix:	n
Xtitle:	chonglab
Xentry:	0
Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993
Xhost:	Un*x v6, pdp11/45
X	2.9BSD, pdp11/70
X---remark---
X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.
X
X    It is likely not to win a prize.  But what do you expect from
X    a short example!

X
X    Typically the build file should assume that the source is prog.c
X    and will compile into prog.  If an entry wins, we will rename
X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,
X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional
X    digit in case of name conflicts.
X
X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,
X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.
X
X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source
X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the
X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful
X    if you did one of the following:
X
X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.
X
X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:
X
X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary
X
X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source
X		cp prog.c special_src.c
X		cc special_src.c -o special_name
X
X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build
X		tail +4 build > special_build
X		sh < special_build
X
X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of 
X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You 
X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.
X
X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,
X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid
X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should
X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This
X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.
X
X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We
X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the
X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them
X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,
X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,
X    then skip the ---info--- section.
X
X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that
X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an
X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample
X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a
X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a
X    'hints' file.
X
X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For
X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed
X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,
X    the entry should not require them exist.
X
X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name
X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,
X    say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they
X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say
X    so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has
X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should
X    have entry number 0.
X
X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry
X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the
X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't
X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the 
X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:
X
X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for
X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries)
X    
X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer 
X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as 
X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:
X
X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993
X
X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The
X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many 
X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:
X
X	date -u "+%a %h %d %T 19%y"
X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/'
X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'
X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'
X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'
X
X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set
X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.
X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number
X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be
X    replaced.
X
X
XJUDGING PROCESS:
X
X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.
X
X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message
X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:
X
X	---entry--- section
X	all ---author--- sections
X	all ---info--- sections
X	---build--- section
X	---program--- section
X	any other text, including the Email message headers
X
X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure
X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was
X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the
X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is
X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.
X
X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular
X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are
X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding
X    out in the end, who won and where they were from.
X
X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.
X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all
X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning
X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even
X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,
X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC
X    winners at talks)
X
X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the
X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give
X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their
X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We
X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.
X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.
X
X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,
X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;
X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does
X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the
X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.
X
X    A reading consists of a number of actions:
X
X	* reading the ---entry--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any
X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor
X	    shipping over any #include files
X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source
X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor
X	    shipping over any #include files
X
X    In later rounds, other actions are performed:
X
X	* linting the source
X	* compiling/building the source
X	* running the program
X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary
X
X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries
X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it
X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.
X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form
X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.
X    An entry often will compete in several categories.
X
X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries
X    we receive.  A typical category list might be:
X
X	* best small one line program
X	* best small program
X	* strangest/most creative source layout
X	* most useful obfuscated program
X	* best game that is obfuscated
X	* most creatively obfuscated program
X	* most deceptive C code
X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)
X	* best abuse of ANSI C
X	* worst abuse of the rules
X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>
X
X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so
X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.
X
X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10
X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into
X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is
X    less clear cut.
X
X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out
X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is
X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry 
X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, 
X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!
X
X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a
X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest
X    rules in some way.
X
X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such
X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the
X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.
X
X
XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:
X
X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,
X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to
X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.
X
X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:
X
X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources
X
X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following
X
X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc
X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x
X
X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See
X    below for details.
X
X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners 
X    have appeared in books ("The New Hackers Dictionary") and on T-Shirts.
X
X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)
X
