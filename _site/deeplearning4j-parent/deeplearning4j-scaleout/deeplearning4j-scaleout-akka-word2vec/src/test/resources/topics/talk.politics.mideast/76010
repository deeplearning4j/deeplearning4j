henrik]Let me clearify Mr. Turkish;

henrik]ARMENIA is NOT getting "itchy". SHE is simply LETTING the WORLD 
henrik] KNOW that SHE WILL NO  LONGER sit there QUIET and LET TURKS get 
henrik] away with their FAMOUS tricks. Armenians DO REMEMBER of the TURKISH 
henrik] invasion of the Greek island of CYPRESS WHILE the world simply WATCHED. 


Esin Terzioglu]  Your ignorance is obvious from your posting. 
Esin Terzioglu]  1) Cyprus was an INDEPENDENT country with Turkish/Greek 
		    inhabitants (NOT a Greek island like your ignorant 
			posting claims)
Esin Terzioglu]  2) The name should be Cyprus (in English)
Esin Terzioglu]  next time read and learn before you post. 



Aside from spelling , why is that you TURKS DO NOT want to admit your
past MISTAKES ? You know TURKISH INVASION of CYPRUS was a mistake and too
bad that U.N. DID NOT do anything about it. You may ask : mistake ?
Yes, I would say. Why is that the GREEKS DID NOT INVADE CYPRUS ?

My response to the "shooting down" of a Turkish airplane over the Armenian
air space was because of the IGNORANT posting of the person from your 
Country. Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the
KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan. The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived
in their HOMELAND for 3000 years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS 
BY STALIN) are the ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending 
themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. Agression that has NO MERCY for INOCENT 
people that are costantly SHELLED with MIG-23's and othe Russian aircraft. 

At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the KARABAKH 
crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER OCCUR again.
