Does the Bates method work?  I first heard about it in this newsgroup 
several years ago, and I have just got hold of a book, "How to improve your
sight - simple daily drills in relaxation", by Margaret D. Corbett, 
('Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953.  It 
talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there been
any study on whether this method actually works?  If it works, is it by 
actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing 
the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the 
too-long eyeball?

Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the most
logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process,
i.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there been
any recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works by 
changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of 
eyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the 
eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates's 
idea, right?)

Thanks for any information.
