Surprise surprise, different people react differently to different things. One
slightly off the subject case in point. My brother got stung by a bee. I know
he is allergic to bee stings, but that his reaction is severe localized
swelling, not anaphylactic shock. I could not convince the doctors of that,
however, because that's not written in their little rule book.

I would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have bad
reactions to MSG, including headaches, stomachaches and even vomiting. Not that
the stuff is BAD or POISON and needs to be banned, but people need to be aware
that it can have a bad effect on SOME people.
