Some survey conducted by the U.S. government and some group (I don't know 
which) did what they were calling on all the news shows this morning, "The most
comprehensive survey of sexuality in the past 50 years".  Not an exact quote, 
but you get the idea.

This low percentage is merely one more in a ton of evidence disproving the 10% 
theory.
