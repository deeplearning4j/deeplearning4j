I need help binding some value to the HOME and END keys on my keyboard.  I have an
rs/6000 w/ aix3.2.3ext running X11R5pl19 mit dist.  I'm using a PC running eXceed
for windows as my xterminal.  The HOME and END keys do not send a value, and my
application needs them to be defined.  I used this in my Xdefaults to define the
keys:

varnet*VT100.Translations: #override \
    <Key>Home: string("\033[8~") \n\
    <Key>End: string("\033[7~")

Then I xterm -name varnet.  This works perfect, however the 7 and the 1 key on my
keypad are also defined as \033[8~ and \033[7~.

Any ideas?  Help please.

Thanks.
