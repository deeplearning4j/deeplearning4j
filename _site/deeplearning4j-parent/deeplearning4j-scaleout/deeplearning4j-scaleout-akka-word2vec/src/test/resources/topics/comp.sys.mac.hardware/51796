Hi everyone. I recently posted about how I received a bad vram chip for my
new LCIII, and someone responded that it may not actually be bad, but it may
be a 512K LC vram chip, and thus doesn't work properly with my computer. So
I'm wondering if anyone can interpret these codes for me, so I can figure
out what type of chip MacConnection sent me.

Each chip says: M518121A-80J
		 2515251

On the back of the card, it says 0593

I believe from the numbers that means it is an 80ns chip, but I can't figure
out what the size is supposed to be. If anyone can help, I'd be grateful.
Please email me your response. Thanks a lot!
