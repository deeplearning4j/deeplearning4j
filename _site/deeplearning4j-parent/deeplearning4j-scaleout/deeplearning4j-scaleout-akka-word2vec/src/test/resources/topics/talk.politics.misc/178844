    The immunization program is just a "useful first step". Among other
    things, the money will go to pay for creating and maintaning a
    a computerized "innoculation" database on all U.S. children.
    (code-named Big Mother... Just kidding, the name will be Children
    Defense Database, or something like that.)

    Once the money is spent and little or no tangible results achieved, 
    the goverment will have to start knocking down doors, in some 
    neigborhoods, and bribe parents in others (probably the ones that 
    are paying kids for attending the school - what a fantastic idea!)
