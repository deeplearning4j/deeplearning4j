Attention hardware hackers and bargain seekers!

I just bought a 640x200 pixel LCD panel for 25 UK pounds.  I have
a datasheet for a similar panel, but I'm looking for proper data.

If anyone can help with locating data for this device (before I start
with the routine on the phone to Hitachi and rummaging through the
library), then I'll pass on the source.

	Type: LM225 (Hitachi)
	Resolution: 640W x 200H (so can do 80x25 chars on 8x8 matrix)

Bought from:

	Greenweld Electronics Ltd
	27 Park Rd
	Southampton SO1 3TB, UK

	Tel. +44 703 23 63 63
	Fax. +44 703 23 63 07
	Email: Compuserve [100014,1463]

NB: I only just bought this!  I don't even know if it works!

	Price was 25 UK pounds including VAT (17.5%), which isn't
	payable if you're outside the EC.

Thanks for any info!


Chris
