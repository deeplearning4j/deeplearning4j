I'd like to compile X11r5 on a Sony NWS-1750 running NEWS 4.1c.  The
X distribution has support for this config, and the release notes say
it has been tested on the machine.  BUT, also in the release notes,
nothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers.  What am I
supposed to use for my r5 X server then?  How can the OS be supported,
but not the hardware? Is there something in the r4 binaries that can
be used as the r5 server? These may seem like silly questions, but
I'm *really* confused.
