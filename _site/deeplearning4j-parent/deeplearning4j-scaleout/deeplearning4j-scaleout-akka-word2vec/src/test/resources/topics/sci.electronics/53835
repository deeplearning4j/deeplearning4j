Well, I'm not too sure if this would be the right place to post this, but
anyway, here goes:  I was just noticing that some of the current bubblejet
printers offers up to 360x360 resolution while a lot of lower end laser
printers only offer 300x300.  However, the laser printers still seems to be
significantly pricier than the bubblejets... how is this?  Or am I missing
something about the resolution thing?
