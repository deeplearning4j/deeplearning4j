And of course, Mike Ramsey was (at one time) the captain in Buffalo prior to
being traded to Pittsburgh.  Currently, the Penguins have 3 former captains
and 1 real captain (Lemieux) playing for them.  They rotate the A's during the
season (and even the C while Mario was out).  Even Troy Loney has worn the C
for the Pens.
