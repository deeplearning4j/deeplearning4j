Dear Folks:

It's a pleasure to be able to announce the release of a new freeware program, 
Xavier, an audio and video  extension to InterViews.

Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library
that adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite
multimedia objects to be built from media objects.

Specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available
in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the
source code for the original classes (though several configuration
files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file). 
 
Currently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN
workstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.

Xavier has been tested in the following environments:

SUN:
  Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC
  OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later
  C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1

NEC(EWS):
  Machine : EWS4800/210,230
  OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2
  C++     : C++ Release3.1

It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from 

         interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/
          (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)

We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier.
If you are interested, please contact
               
                   xavier@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp. 

I will add your e-mail address to our list.
