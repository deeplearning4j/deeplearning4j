Yes,

Take Interstate I-70 to the route 48 exit.  Go south on 48 about
2-1/2 miles.  Trun right on Shiloh Springs Road.  The hamvention is
at the Harrah arena, which is about 1 mile west and on the north
side of the Road.  Parking at the arena is limited.  Lodging is
probably entirely booked-up within a 40 mile radius.  Good luck.

It is possible to park at the mall to the west.  There are shuttle
busses running between the arena and the mall.

If possible, get a Montgomery County, OH map from your local AAA
office.  It should be free if you are an AAA member.

If you don't already have definite plans, now is not a particularly
good time to start to think about going to the hamvention.
