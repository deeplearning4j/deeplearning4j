I think the support droid was malfunctioning and confused the disk space
limit with the virtual address space limit.  As far as the disk is
concerned, you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space.
The limit that causes the message, "Windows will only use ...," is the
amount of virtual address space that the Virtual Memory Manager will
create, and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have
when Windows starts.

In the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI, you can specify a parameter:

	PageOverCommit=multiplier

The following description is from the Windows Resource Kit:

	This entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of
	linear address space the VMM will create for the system, which is
	computed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to
	the nearest 4 MB and then multiplying that value by the value
	specified for PageOverCommit=.  Increasing this value increases the
	amount of available linear address space, causing the size of data
	structures to increase.  This also increases paging activity
	proportionately and can slow down the system.  You can specify a
	value between 1 and 20.  The default is 4.  To change this entry,
	you must edit SYSTEM.INI.
