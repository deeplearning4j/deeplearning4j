	Please define "morally straight". 

	
	
	And, don't even try saying that "straight", as it is used here, 
implies only hetersexual behavior. [ eg: "straight" as in the slang word 
opposite to "gay" ]


	This is alot like "family values". Everyone is talking about them, 
but misteriously, no one knows what they are.
