It's supposedly a high-performance chip based upon workstation graphics
accelerators.  It's quite fast (I have 7), but as usual with new boards/chips
the drivers are buggy for Windows.  As far as Winmarks go, it depends upon
the version.  I think I got 42M winmarks with version 3.11.  2.5 yielded the
50+ number.  I've also benchmarked this with Wintach at over 65 (from memory
as well).

As far as the low-level stuff goes, it looks pretty nice.  It's got this
quadrilateral fill command that requires just the four points.

It's very fast, but beware of buggy drivers, and otherwise no non-windows
support.
