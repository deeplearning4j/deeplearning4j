Women's pants rarely have pockets and most, when they do, are too
shallow to use!

I is very important for a woman to have her keys in her hand when
she goes from building to a car. It is protect herself from
would be assilants by broadcasting that this is someone who
as a definite place of safty (ie a locked car!).

Puting keys and walet looks ugly! It breaks the lines and makes
you rear look wide as a cows!

 Also, to have the habits that
work for any clothing situation, the pruse functions no mater
what you are wearing! (even nude or a bikni)

A women's suit coat is lucky to have 2 pockets (2 on the outside,
none on the inside). I have men's coats that have as much as 6
pockets! This is definitally not fair!!!

As one that wears both men's and women's clothes, I can tell you,
women's clothes have few if any funtional pockets!

When dressed as a man, I put my wallet on my inside coat pocket and
my keys in a coat outside pocket. It is much more covenent
than the pants pockets and looks better.

Having a car that unlocks quickly and locks back fast is
paramout to a woman's safty. Men don't see this as a problem.
A woman is aware of this every time she goes out! (i.e.
Image some red necks yelling at you "We are going to FUCK YOU!"
and the out weight you by 20 lbs and have 3 inches in hight
on you!)

If you want to find out why a women does something, LIVE AS ONE!
