Oh come on, Silly, all you have to do is cut a hole in your hood and 
put a tube there so you can get to the oil fill hole.  What do you
think all those big air intake things are for on those hot-rod cars?
They're just for looks only...little does anyone know, they provide
access to the oil-fill hole.

Well, over where we live, we have problems with vandals stealing 
people's wheels.  Those locking nuts didn't stop them.  So to be
safe and sure, I welded the lug nuts to my wheels together.  It
works, serious!  I haven't had my wheels stolen yet!
