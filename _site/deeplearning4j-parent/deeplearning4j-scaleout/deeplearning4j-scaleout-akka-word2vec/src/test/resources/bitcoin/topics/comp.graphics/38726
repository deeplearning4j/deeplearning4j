       Moscow Scientific Inductrial Association "Spectrum" offer
       VIDEOSCAN vision system for PC/AT,wich include software and set of
       controllers.

                     SOFTWARE

            For support VIDEOSCAN family program kit was developed. Kit
       includes more then 200 different functions for image processing.
            Kit works in the interactive regime, and has include Help for
       non professional users.
            There are next possibility:
       - input frame by any board of VIDEOSCAN family;
       - read - white image to - from disk;
       - print image on the printer;
       - makes arithmetic with 2 frames;
       - filter image;
       - work with gistogramme;
       - edit image.
       - include users exe modules.

                     CONTROLLER VS9

       The function of VS-9 controller is to load TV-images into  PC/AT.
       VS-9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV-frame from
       a field of 724x600 pixels.
       The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in
       the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image. This
       provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal
       and vertical directions.
       The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.
       Video signal capture time - 2.5s.

                     CONTROLLER VS52

       The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM
       PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was
       created on the base of modern elements, including user
       programmable gate arrays.
       The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different
       resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change
       technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any
       other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning
       devices).
       The controller has the following technical characteristics:
       - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;
       - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64
       to 1024x512 pixels ;
       - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024
       pixels;
       - video signal capture time - 40 ms.
       - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024
       pixels ;
       - number of gray level - 256 ;
       - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;
       - 4 input video multiplexer ;
       - input/output lookup table (LUT);
       - possibility to realize "scroll" and "zoom";













       - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external
       controlling signal) ;
       - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -
       digital converter;
       - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.
       One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the
       controller by reprogramming it.


              IMAGE PROCESSOR VS100


            Image processor VS100 allows to digitize and process TV
       signal in real time. It is possible digitize TV signal with
       512*512*8 resolution and realize arithmetic and logic operation
       with two images.
            Processor was created on the base of modern elements
       including user programmable gate arrays and designed as a board
       for PC.
            Memory volume allows write to the 256 frames with 512*512*8
       format. It is possible to accumulate until 16 images.
            The processor has the following technical characteristics:
       - memory volume to 64 Mb;
       - number of the gray level - 256;
       - 4 input video multiplexer;
       - input/output lookup table;
       - electronic adjustment for black and white ADC reference;
       - image size from 256*256 to 8192*8192;
       - possibility color and black / white output;
       - possibility input from slow-scan video sources.
