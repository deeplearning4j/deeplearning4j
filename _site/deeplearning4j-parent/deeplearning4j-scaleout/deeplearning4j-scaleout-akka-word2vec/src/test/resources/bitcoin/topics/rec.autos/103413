Summary: My air vents don't work on my 71 Skylark

I have a '71 Buick Skylark with 148K on it.  I bought it in California, and if
it'll let me, I'd like to keep it for another year.  The only problem is these
Indiana winters--my heater controls don't work.

The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it is
stuck in the "vent" mode.  It will blow warm air, but I can't switch the air
flow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can't 
live without this).  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the 
defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well,
kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.

I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think
the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down
and outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in-
side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is
probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.

Two questions:

	1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than
	the fact that I should move from Indiana) ?

	2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there
	a way to "fix" this?

THanks for any advice/info

selah,
