Hi Folks,

   Does anyone have a copy of Playmation they'd be willing to sell me.  I'd 
love to try it out, but not for the retail $$$.  If you have moved onto 
something bigger (3DS) or better (Imagine), I'd love to buy your table scraps.

   If noone is selling, can anyone recommend a place to buy Playmation 
mail-order for cheap?  

   Thanks in advance,

   Mark
