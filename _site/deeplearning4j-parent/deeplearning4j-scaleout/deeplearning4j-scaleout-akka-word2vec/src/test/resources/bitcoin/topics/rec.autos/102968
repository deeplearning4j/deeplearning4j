They light the highways in Texas?  Funny, everywhere else I've been
they only light 'em at junctions.

I won't even get into how much road markings vary between states and
localities except to say that there are some areas where markings are
essentially nonexistant.

I suspect you have very limited experience -- US freeways vary
dramatically, particularly between states.  I can name a number of
interstate highways in various parts of the country where 130 would be
very optimistic in any car.

I'm not sure what you call "quite severe" in terms of road deviations
but I suspect every single bridge junction on I84 through CT would be
considered so.  They're hard to take at 85mph.  That's not the only
interstate I've seen with such deviations, but it's one I drive
frequently.

Texas is pretty much an edge-case -- you can't assume that everywhere
has roads in such good condition, such flat terrain, and such
wide-open spaces.  It just ain't so.
