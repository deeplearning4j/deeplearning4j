Is that what turns you on? The truth needs to be told over and over 
again. There are Armenians who of course witnessed the Armenian genocide 
of 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914-1920 but their voices of truth 
are suppressed today in the hollow din of anti-Turkish/Muslim campaign
by the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle of the fascist 
x-Soviet Armenian Government. Well, that is what I saw in the library.
What's your problem with this?

"It seems that terrorism against their own co-nationals has been a prominent
 part of the revolutionary activities of the Dashnag leaders of the Caucasus.
 Organized to fight the Turks, these chieftains have been more successful
 in their fight against their Armenian opponents in Turkey, and the Caucasus,
 very often defenseless and innocent."

p. 38.

"The fact remains, however, that the leaders of the Turkish Armenian section
 of the Dashnagtzoutune did not carry out their promise of loyalty to the
 Turkish cause when the Turks entered the war...and a call was sent for 
 Armenian volunteers to fight the Turks on the Caucasian front."

"Thousands of Armenians from all over the world, flocked to the standards of
 such famous fighters as Antranik, Kery, Dro, etc. The Armenian volunteer
 regiments rendered valuable service to the Russian Army in the years of
 1914-15-16."

 "I had received further very definite information of horrors that
  had been committed by the Armenian soldiery in Kars Plain, and as 
  I had been able to judge of their want of discipline by their 
  treatment of my own detached parties, I had wired to Tiflis from 
  Zivin that 'in the interests of humanity the Armenians should not 
  be left in independent command of the Moslem population, as, their 
  troops being without discipline and not under effective control, 
  atrocities were constantly being committed, for which we should 
  with justice eventually be held to be morally responsible'."

 "Armenian troops, who, having pillaged and destroyed all the
  Moslem villages in the plain...."

 "Caravans of refugees were in the meanwhile constantly arriving from the
  plain, from which the whole Moslem population was fleeing with as much of
  their personal property as they could transport, seeking to obtain security
  and protection..."

p. 178 (first paragraph)

 "In those Moslem villages in the plain below which had been searched 
  for arms by the Armenians everything had been taken under the cloak of 
  such search, and not only had many Moslems been killed, but horrible 
  tortures had been inflicted in the endeavour to obtain information as 
  to where valuables had been hidden, of which the Armenians were aware 
  of the existence, although they had been unable to find them."

p. 179 (first paragraph)

 "Shortly afterwards the head of the miserable column appeared. There 
  were in all about 200 persons, mostly old men and women and children, 
  with a few ox-carts, ponies, and donkeys, carrying all their worldly 
  possessions, except a few sheep that they were driving before them. 
  Their leader interviewed Bekir Bey, and was told to keep farther on 
  into the hills, where he would be able to cross the frontier into 
  Turkey unmolested by his enemies."

p. 181 (first paragraph)

 "the Armenians from the plain were attacking the Kurdish line with 
  artillery, with probably a large force in support."

p. 175 (first paragraph)

 "The arrival of this British brigade was followed by the announcement
  that Kars Province had been allotted by the Supreme Council of the
  Allies to the Armenians, and that announcement having been made, the
  British troops were then completely withdrawn, and Armenian occupation
  commenced. Hence all the trouble; for the Armenians at once commenced
  the wholesale robbery and persecution of the Muslem population on the
  pretext that it was necessary forcibly to deprive them of their arms.
  In the portion of the province which lies in the plains they were able
  to carry out their purpose, and the manner in which this was done will
  be referred to in due course."

AZERBAIJAN'S GOVERNMENT APPEALS TO COMPATRIOTS ALL OVER THE WORLD

   BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, Azerbaijan's government appealed 
to Azeris all over the world in connection with escalation of the 
Armenian aggression against the republic.  
  It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fighting
for independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The war
against Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of 
the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction of
Azeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60
thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place.
This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule,
is said in the document. 
   Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every
effort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan,
and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.
   It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine,
food, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees from
Kelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the 
sick and the wounded men.--O--

citizens, encircled on alpine villages of the region of Kelbajar

   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Azerbaijanis, living in Moscow, picketed
in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.

PICKET OF SADVALERS IN MOSCOW

   BAKU (5 APRIL) 30-40 members of "Sadval" society picketed before
the building of permanent representation of Azerbaijan in Moscow.
Picketers were demanding the return of Lezghins lands, as if annexed
by Azerbaijan.
   Ambassador of Azerbaijan in Moscow, Hikmet Haji-zade classified
this action as provocation aimed at creating a further inter-ethnic
conflict in Azerbaijan. He marked in his talk with the Turan
correspondent that he does not rule out a connection between the
Armenian aggression in the region of Kelbajar and this anti-
azerbaijani action of the "Sadval" society in Moscow. He also
marked that 30-40 people do not mean the Lezghian nationality in
the whole.
   Society of Lezghins, "Sadval", registered in Moscow in 1990,
demands the creation of a Lezghistan state, which never existed
before on the northern territories of Azerbaijan.--0--

STATEMENT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF AZERBAIJAN

   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan 
issued a statement in connection with aggression of Armenia in the
region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan.
   It is stated in the statement that regular units of the armed
forces of Armenia captured the town of Kelbajar on April 3 .
  Attack of Armenian units, which began on March 27 deep in the
territory of Azerbaijan still continues. Armenia has occupied at
present 7500 sq.km of the territory of Azerbaijan.
   Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari (Upper)
Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered a
specially dangerous phase. This is the result of non-recognition of 
Armenia as an aggressor by the international community, is marked
in the document.
   It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russian
army are participating in the Armenian attack. This casts doubt on
the sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peaceful
solution to the conflict.
   It is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of Armenia 
have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of CSCE.
   The document contains the appeal to the world community to stop
Armenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctions
against the aggressor.--0--
