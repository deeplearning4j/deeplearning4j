Okay, that's good.  I'm typing this from exactly the same setup.
(US-UNIX layout keyboard)  I did install the sunkbd patch, though.

Make sure you're using "ssetroot", which comes with tvtwm.  When tvtwm
starts up, it nukes the existing root window.  Use an "ssetroot" after
tvtwm starts up.   (You could spawn off a "(sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&")
You can also use "VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename" or just
VirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey.

Did you install the sunkbd patch?  It's in the contrib directory on export.
All the keys on my keyboard send events properly, except the following:
The End, PageUp, PageDown on the 6-key cluster aren't recognized.
Even the compose key works.  (Though I can't seem to get the composed
characters in an xterm to get passed.)

Anyone have a fix for the last two?
