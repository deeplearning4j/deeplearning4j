Wrong on both accounts.

No one is a "rioter" until they participate in a "riot", which is 
unlikely to happen, now.

Most of the *people* in L.A. are likely to have gotten up early to 
listen to the court announcement.

Sorry to disappoint you, but this seems unlikely.

I don't think he was told.
However, his statement was still appropriate.

Jury duty is a solemn duty to be taken seriously.  It is not meant 
to be a source of pride or instant fame.

Well, the many *people* who got up early to go to the court to hear 
the verdict found that justice was served.  Given your dire and 
cynical predictions, I imagine that it is you who will be surprised.  :-)
