You can dream whatever you wish. We have demands from the Armenians.
With the Government of x-Soviet Armenia, we would sit down, go over
all our outstanding issues, whether it's land or reparations or
recognition, whatever it is. We'd like to sit down and ask for it.
By all means, lands and properties were taken away from us and they
should be returned to the rightful owners, the Turkish and Kurdish 
people, who were there 3,000 years, long before the Armenians ever
showed up in that area. Entire population of the region was subjected 
to genocide beyond belief; genocide which was planned to exterminate 
the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man, woman and child. 
Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians. To 
assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings 
was one of their methods. Even today the traveler in that region is seldom 
free from the evidence of these Armenian crimes.

If you have the stomach, I would strongly recommend the following
references on the Armenian genocide of the Muslims. Many more of them
are also available in the 'Erzurum and Van Turkish Genocide Museums.'

But more than that. 

A Final Goodbye in Azerbaijan:

members and friends grieved during the burial of victims killed in the 
fighting in Nagorno-Karabagh. Chingiz Iskandarov, right, hugged the 
coffin containing the remains of his brother, one of the victims. A copy 
of Koran lay atop the coffin."

Final Embrace :

coffin holding the remains of his brother as other relatives grieve 
at an Azarbaijani cemetery yesterday amid burial of victims killed 
in fighting in Nagorno-Karabagh."

Nagorno-Karabagh Victims Buried in Azerbaijani Town :

"Refugees Claim Hundreds died in Armenian Attack...Of seven bodies seen 
 here today, two were children and three were women, one shot through 
 the chest at what appeared to be close range.  Another 120 refugees 
 being treated at Agdam's hospital include many with multiple stab 
 wounds."
