I know for a fact that the EISA version of the Orchid ProDesigner IIS
works.  However, an EISA SVGA card is likely a waste of money.

When XFree86 2.0 comes out, with support for accelerated chipsets, ISA,
EISA, and VLB will all be supported.

The more important question is "what chipsets are supported?".  The bus
is basically irrelevent as a compatibility issue.
