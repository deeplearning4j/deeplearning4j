Garrett, you are a really pathetic liar.

Some of your charges are arguable, but most of them are obvious lies.

I challenge you to present us with any evidence that Nixon stole,
rigged a national election, never mind elections, or used the powers
of his office for personal gain.

You can't because there is absolutely no evidence that any of these
events occurred.

Your sad level of historical and political knowlege is probably best
exemplified by the fact that you think PRC stands for Cambodia instead
of Red China.
