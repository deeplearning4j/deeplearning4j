I have an SE/30 with a 80 meg HD which dates back to April 1989.  When I
originally purchased it, I experienced the failure to boot problem.  This
was fixed soon after by a ROM upgrade on the hard drive.

Lately a similar problem has been occuring.  When the computer is
powered on the HD light flashes a few times and then I am given
the "no disk to boot from" icon.  However, upon turing the
computer off and on again the drive ALWAYS boots up just fine.  
Furthermore, if instead of turning the power on and off I press the reboot 
button the same problem occurs.  But, as I said, turning the power
off and on always works.

This problem is different from the 1989 boot problem in that before
it often required several power off and ons to get it to boot.

Does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how
it can be fixed?

I'm wondering if it's getting old and requires more time to 
"come up to speed" now.  Is there a PRAM or SCSI setting that
allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before 
trying to access the HD?

Thanks!
