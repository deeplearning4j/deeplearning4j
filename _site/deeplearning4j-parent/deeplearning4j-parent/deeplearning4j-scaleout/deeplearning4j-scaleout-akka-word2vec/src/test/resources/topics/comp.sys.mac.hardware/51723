After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide, I
came up with:
ATZ0L2N2X5&D0S11=50^M
This is entered in the 'Initialize' box on the 'Modem Preferences' in Zterm.
Quick summary of each commmand:
Z0	- Reset modem to User Profile 0.
L2	- Speaker volume at 2 (fairly quiet)
N2	- Ring volume at 2 (fairly quiet)
X5	- Display connect info according to setting 5 (see manual)
&D0	- Assume DTR (computer) is always on
S11=50	- Dial speed at 50 (as fast as ZyXEL can handle)

In FirstClass, I used this same string, with the addition of S0=0 right
before the S11 command, in the setup box.  This disables the auto-answer 
function of the modem for FirstClass.  I based my modem setting on the Supra
14.4FAX, and just changed the above mentioned string.

In Telefinder, I based my setting on the Zoom V42 - HH setting.  I changed
the 'Modem Initialization' string to the same one I used for FirstClass, and
everything seems to work fine.

Sorry it took so long to get this summary out.  If someone wants to forward
this to the /info-mac/reports directory at sumex-aim, it might save other
newbie ZyXEL users like myself the trouble of setting up their strings, and
also save the net some redundant messages.  If anyone else has something
to add, feel free.
