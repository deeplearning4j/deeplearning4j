They are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust'
is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during 
the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, 
assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people 
because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts 
of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, 
set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts 
behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly 
attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population 
indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent 
Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with 
axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt
alive as can be seen below.

Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions 
of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and 
Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion,
also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from 
behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of 
Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed 
widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena
was left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from 
Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide 
by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian, 
Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French 
journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century
committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.

The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum, 
Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their 
villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred.
The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for
humanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German,
Austrian, French and American authorities.

Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and 
cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by 
Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish 
and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. 
Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of 
the victims of these cruelties can be heard.

"I have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of Russians and
 Armenians from Turkish territories through Armenia. Although two months
 have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I
 have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at 
 almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from
 Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly
 slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to
 save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful
 events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then
 taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people 
 well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these
 places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.
 They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the
 Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality
 problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers
 who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and
 Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the 
 Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs. 
 I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is 
 destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are 
 speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as 
 well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is 
 proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war."
