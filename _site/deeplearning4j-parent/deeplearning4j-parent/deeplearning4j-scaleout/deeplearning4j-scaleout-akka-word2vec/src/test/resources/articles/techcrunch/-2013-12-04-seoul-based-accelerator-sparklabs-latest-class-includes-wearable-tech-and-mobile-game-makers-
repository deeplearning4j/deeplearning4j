Rubin’s Robots: Google Gears Up To Revolutionize Manufacturing And Logistics
SparkLabs has unveiled the latest group of startups participating in its Seoul-based accelerator program. The current batch includes locally-based companies, as well as teams from Tokyo, San Francisco and Chicago. SparkLabs alumni previously profiled by TechCrunch include edutech startup KnowRe , personal journaling app Step Journal and fantasy stock trading community TrakInvest .
SparkLabs recently launched a $30 million seed stage fund called SparkLabs Global to focus on emerging economies throughout the world, but its accelerator’s mission continues to be raising the profile of Seoul’s fledgling startup ecosystem. South Korea’s tech industry is best known for hardware giants like Samsung and LG, but more Internet startups are hatching in the country. Spearheaded by a group of Korean-American entrepreneurs, SparkLabs seeks to provide founders with a network of mentors on par with the ones their peers in Silicon Valley have access to, in addition to angel funding and non-financial resources.
SparkLabs’ latest roster of startups represent sectors including wearable tech, telecom, online gaming and medical devices. They are:
Tokyo-based FeelU, which creates wearable devices including RingU , an interactive ring that lets you give people you miss a “hug” no matter how far away from each other you are. RingU is connected to a private social network that also allows people to share messages, photos and videos.
Flow State Media is a social and mobile game studio with a staff that includes former employees from Zynga, as well as MIT alumni. The startup’s casual games for mobile and PC devices include Letter UP , which was released at the end of June and has already logged more than 1.5 million minutes of gameplay. Flow State Media is currently preparing a “fresh take” on social casino games for release later this year.
