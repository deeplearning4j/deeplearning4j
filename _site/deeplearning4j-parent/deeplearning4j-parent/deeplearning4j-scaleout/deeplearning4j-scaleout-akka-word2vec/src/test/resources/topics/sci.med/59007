YES!

I call this notion "psychological health food" and, in fact, have
determined that the Four Food Groups are Ice Cream, Pizza, Barbecue, and
Chocolate.  Ideally, every meal should contain something from at least two
of these four groups.  Food DOES serve functions other than nutrition, and
one of them is keeping the organism happy and thus aiding its immune
system. 

And I didn't spend a million bucks commissioning a study that told me to
redraw my silly little pyramid in different colors and with a friendlier
typeface, either.  (Ref: Consumer Reports' back page--one of the best
things ever to turn up there.)

Yeah, I want to try one of those 42oz steaks (cooked over applewood) at
Wally's Wolf Lodge Inn in Coeur d'Alene.  That seems quite
unrealistic--unrealistically SMALL.  And a few slabs of ribs from the East
Texas Smoker (RIP, again) in Louisville is not at all unrealistic either.  

What say we have a rec.food.cooking dinner at the Moonlite Bar-B-Que Inn in
Owensboro? (It's all you can eat including lamb ribs & mutton for about
$10.)  We could invite Julie Kangas as guest of honor and see if the
Moonlite's Very Hot Sauce is too hot for her.  (It IS too hot for me, and I
don't say that very often.)  And she could bring ice cream with crushed
dried chiltepins for dessert.  

And we could see if there IS such a thing as an "unrealistically large
quantity" of barbecue--the owner of the Moonlite estimates that the
Owensboro restaurants serve a hundred thousand pounds of meat a week in the
summer, and forty thousand in the winter--in a town of 50 000 or so.  Two
pounds per person per week?   Again, sure sounds unrealistic to me--thats
just too meager to be healthy.
