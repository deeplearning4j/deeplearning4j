Koberg,

	Just a couple of minor corrections here...

	1)  The Churches of Christ do not usually believe in speaking in
tongues, in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to
Pentecostal teaching.  You are probably thinking of Church of God in
Christ, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.

	2)  I'm not sure what you mean by "signifying believers"  but it
should be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it
ever, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian. 
The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is
that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming
a Christian in which one is "Baptized in the Holy Spirit"  That may be
what you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are
frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order
to be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the
majority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in
Mark 16 about "these signs following them that believe" but they generally
do not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't
"saved".

	3)  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that
has such diversity, but I think you've made some pretty big
generalizations here.  Do "Neo-Pentecostals" only believe in tongues as a
sign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message? 
I've never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them
as believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as
a sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be
inclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend,
they do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be
charismatic.
