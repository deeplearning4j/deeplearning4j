I believe you have the correct files. I think what you'll have to
do is go back into Setup and choose change video adapter or
whatever it is called. Then the trick is choose the same adaptor
you currently have. What Setup does is it actually changes the
file WIN.COM whenever you go into it and change the video
hardware selection. It incorporates the contents of VGALOGO.RLE
into WIN.COM when you do this. This trick can also be used to
change the startup logo into whatever you want it to be.
