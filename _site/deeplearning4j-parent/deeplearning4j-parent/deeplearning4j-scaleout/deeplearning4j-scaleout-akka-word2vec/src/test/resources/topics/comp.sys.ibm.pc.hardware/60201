I love it when magazine writers make stupid statements like that re:
performance. Where do they get those numbers? I'll list the actual
performance ranges, which should convince anyone that such a
statement is absurd:

SCSI-I ranges from 0-5MB/s.
SCSI-II ranges from 0-40MB/s.
IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s.
ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions)
