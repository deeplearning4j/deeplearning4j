I am told (by the person who I care a lot about and who I am worried
is going to start putting his health and money into homeopathy without
really knowing what he is getting into and who is the reason I posted
in the first place about homeopathy) that in Britain homeopathy is
available on the National Health Service and that there are about 6000
GPs who use homeopathic practices. True? False? What?

Have there been any important and documented investigations into
homeopathic principles?

I was reading a book on homeopathy over the weekend. I turned to the
section on the principles behind homeopathic medicine, and two
paragraphs informed me that homeopaths don't feel obliged to provide
any sort of explanation. The author stated this with pride, as though
it were some sort of virtue! Why am I sceptical about homeopathy? Is
it because I am a narrow-minded bigot, or is it because homeopathy
really looks more like witch-doctory than anything else?

Daniele.
