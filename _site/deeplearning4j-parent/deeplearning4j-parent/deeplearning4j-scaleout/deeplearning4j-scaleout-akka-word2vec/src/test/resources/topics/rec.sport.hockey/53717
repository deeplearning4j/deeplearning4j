As far as I know Dusseldorf has only one Canadian-German forward (i.e. a  player
who was born in Canada but now has a German passport). 
Benoit Doucet became german by marriing a german and he is going to play 
for Germany in the WC.

The other Canada-born forwards are:
	Peter-John Lee (has British passport)
	Chris Valentine
	Dale Dercatch
	Steve Gootas
 	Earl Spry (?)

At the moment there are only three German-born forwards coming into my mind:
	Bernd Trunschka, Andreas Brockmann, Ernst Koepf
