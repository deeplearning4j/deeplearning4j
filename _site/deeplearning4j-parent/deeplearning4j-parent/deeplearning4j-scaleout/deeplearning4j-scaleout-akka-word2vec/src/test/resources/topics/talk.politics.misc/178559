Excuse me for sticking my nose in, but any parent/parents who do not allready 
immunize their children (especially if it is already free), don't deserve one 
frigging dime of tax money for health care for themselves, or public health 
care service.

(I know the immunization program and the coming national health care issue are 
slightly seperate issues, but anybody who wouldn't help their kids, don't 
deserve my tax help).
