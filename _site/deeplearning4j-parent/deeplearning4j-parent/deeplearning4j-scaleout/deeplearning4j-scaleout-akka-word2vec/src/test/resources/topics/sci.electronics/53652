If you are going to use one where it counts (eg:aviation, space scuttle, 
etc) then I suggest you go and buy a Fluke (never seen a Beckman), however 
for every other use you can buy a cheapie. I have a metex which is some 
made up name, as I have seen the same DMM with other brand names on it, I 
bought it about 4 yrs ago for Aus$125.00 (convert that to US and you see 
that it's definetly a cheapie.) So far it has proved to be accurate, taken 
moderate abuse, and has many features on it (CAP, FREQ,Transistor check, 
etc). I am very happy with it and would definetly not buy a fluke just for 
the name. Hope this helps.

Cheers
