It depends on what you'd like your joystick for.  I've seen Gravis
joysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my
hand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than
a year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability
to adjust the tension of the stick.

I recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and
no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. 
I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works
quite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so
leaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear
and feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or
down in features.

For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here
compared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra
$10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson
to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.

Just another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something
that needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle
Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up,
down, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into
a Gravis gamepad.  They look like a Nintendo control pad but I don't know
much beyond that.
