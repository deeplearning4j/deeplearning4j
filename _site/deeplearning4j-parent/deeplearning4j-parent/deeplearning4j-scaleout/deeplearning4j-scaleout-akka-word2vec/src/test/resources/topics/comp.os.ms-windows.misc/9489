Perusing through my Windows 3.1 directory, I came across a file
called REGLOAD.EXE.  I assume this is part of the registration
database, but neither my Windows manual, Win Resource Kit, nor
PC Mag's description of files in the Windows directory had a
reference to it.  At least not one that I could find.  Does
REGEDIT.EXE use it?  Or am I way off base?
