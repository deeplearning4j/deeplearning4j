Excuse me but I do know what I safety is supposed to do.  It's basic purpose -
not to let the gun fire until you're ready.  Christ, I've known that since I
had my first Crosman air gun.  You don't know me so don't make assumptions
about what I know and don't know.  I do know that the Glock has multiple
safties from reports, looking at them at a gun shop, and friends who own one.

From the things I have read/heard Glocks are always knocked because of the
trigger safety.  They are supposedly harder to learn to use properly.  Every
article that I have read can't be wrong about the damn thing.  And don't ask
me to quote my sources because I don't keep a ton of gun magazines and/or
rec.guns articles laying around.  Boy, you can't make a simple statement on
here without someone getting right on your ass.  No wonder why there are so
many problems in the world.  Everyone takes everything just a little too
seriously.  By the way,  I'm not going to reply to any of this stuff anymore as
someone made the good point that this discussion is getting too close to r.g
(And yes I know that I had something to do with that).
