   This is probably too simplistic for some, but John 3:16 saus,
   "For God so loved the world that He gave His only son, that
   whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life".

   Genesis 15:6, "And he (Abram) believed the LORD; and He reckoned
   it to him as righteousness".

   I don't find anywhere that God restricts heaven to particular
   ethnic groups or religious denominations or any other category
   that we humans like to drop people into. But He does REQUIRE
   that we believe and trust Him. In Hebrews it says that God spoke
   of old by the prophets (the old testament), but in these last days
   he has spoken to us by His son Jesus Christ. And we learn of
   Him through the pages of the New Testament. The Bible tells us
   what we need to believe. For those who have never heard, I leave
   them in God's capable care, He will make himself known as he
   desires. It behooves each one of us to act upon the knowledge
   we have. If you reject the claims of Jesus, and still go to
   heaven, then the joke's on me. If you reject him and go to hell,
   that's no joke, but it will be final.
