I have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that
were on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an
owners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:
Front, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and
33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi
instead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run
at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.

The real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for
the front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon
Roadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger
than that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,
and was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first
motorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner
tube qualities?

The above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current
rear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought
100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be
very good at getting close to matching mail order prices.

I am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the
front and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer 
lasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and
FJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive
behavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable
back end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving
much better tire milage life. Any comments?

A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very
good, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to
mount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be
careful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to
check out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and
I havn't had a chance to check the rim type.

On another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)
Vetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually
I would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be
fork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame
mounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower
bars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition
runner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly
accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'
style. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is
just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)
