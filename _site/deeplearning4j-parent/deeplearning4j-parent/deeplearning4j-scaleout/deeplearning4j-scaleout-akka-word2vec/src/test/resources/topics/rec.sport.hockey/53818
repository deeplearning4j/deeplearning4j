	It's not really crap you know... only half crap ;-)   From what i 
understand it's very expensive to play hockey south of the border... 
(actually it's not that cheap up hear either... though once you have all the
equipement it's not more than $300 a year... actually i haven' played in
about 8 years so i could be off a bit... )  In the states, where ice time
is considerably more expensive it can cost over a thousand a year... compare 
this to baseball and you'll see that hockey is a sport for the well-to-do...
And this brings up the fact that the well-to-do in the US are majority white...

BTW: what was the original question... i think it has to do with the Hispanic
communtiy and playing hockey.... 


					Cheers!

If the University of Waterloo had on opinion, this probably wouldn't be it...
