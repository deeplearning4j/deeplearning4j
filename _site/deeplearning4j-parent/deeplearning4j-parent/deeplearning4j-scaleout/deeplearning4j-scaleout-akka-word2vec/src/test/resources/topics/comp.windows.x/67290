Hi !

I am using Xview 3.0 on a Sparc IPX under Openwindows along with a XVideo board
from Parallax which enables me to use 24 bit color. I am having some problems
utilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter.

I use Xview to create a Frame and then create a canvas pane inside which I use
to display live video. My video input is 24 bit color.

The problem is that my top level frame created as
	frame = (Frame) xv_create(NULL,FRAME,NULL);
seems to have a depth of 8 which is propagated to my canvas.

I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits.
I tried using the following Xlib code :

XVisualInfo visual_info;
int depth = 24;
Colormap colormap;
XSetWindowAttributes attribs;
unsigned long valuemask = 0;
Window *win;
Xv_opaque frame;

win = xv_get(frame,XV_XID);
XMatchVisualInfo(display,screen,depth,TrueColor,&visual_info);

/* So far so good */

colormap = XCreateColormap(display,win,visual_info,AllocNone);

/* It dies here with a BadMatch error :( */

attribs.colormap = colormap;
valuemask |= CWColormap;
XChangeWindowAttributes(display,w,valuemask,&attribs);
XSetWindowColormap(display,win,colormap);


Am I using a completely wrong approach here ? Is it possible to set the depth
and colormap for a window created by Xview ? What am I doing wrong ?

Thanks in advance for any help that I can get. I would prefer a response via
email although a post on the newsgroup is also okay.

Thanks again,


Alok.
