Steve,  you're the one who suggested that a failed government should be an 
ideal proving ground,  I never felt that way in the first place.  Quite the 
contrary,  I think a better proving ground would be someplace that already
had a governemnt that would prevent outright acts of agression,  yet had a
strong spirit of individualism and initiative.  Someplace like... Texas :-)
