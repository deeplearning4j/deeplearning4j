I just tried a few experiments. I cat'd a 20261-byte file (471 lines)
under various scenarios:

PC-Xview for DOS in a full-screen OS/2 window (1024x768x16):    18 sec
Telix (DOS) in an OS/2 window (1024xs768x256):                  107 sec!
Telix (DOS) is a full-screen OS/2 window (standard VGA):        11 sec
Telix (DOS) in a Windows 3.1 window (1024x768x256):             30 sec
UW/WIN in a seamless OS/2 window (1024x768x256):        gave up after 4 min!
UW/WIN in Windows 3.1 (1024x768x256):           faster, but gave up after 2 min
UW/WIN in a seamless OS/2 window using pg       30 sec, could have been a
                                                little faster (I had to keep
                                                hitting the space bar)

I was using an ATI Wonder XL video card, by the way.

So PC-Xview for DOS looks pretty good (and the line-by-line scrolling
in OS/2 desktop looks pathetic, although full-page redraws are pretty
good).

I tried it under PC-Xview using my normal (9x15bold or 10x20) font,
and with a very small font, and there was no difference in the times.
The modem receive light was on pretty solidly, so it looks like the
bottleneck was the 9600-baud modem, not the screen drawing.
