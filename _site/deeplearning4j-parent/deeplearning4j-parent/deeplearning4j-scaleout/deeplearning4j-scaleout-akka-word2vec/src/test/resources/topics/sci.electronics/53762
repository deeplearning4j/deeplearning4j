The rule for the designations is that if it says MC, that means it works
*exactly* the way the datasheet/book specifies.  If it says XC, that means
there is at least one known bug.  Often these bugs are small and obscure;
you might never run into them in practice.

At least Motorola admits it, unlike certain other companies...
