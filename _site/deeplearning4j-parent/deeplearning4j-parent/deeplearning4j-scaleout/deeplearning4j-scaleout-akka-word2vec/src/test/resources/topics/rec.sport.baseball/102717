decided to add my own fuel to the fire:
They might seem a bit normal, but there are a few (albeit, small) surprises.

The St. Louis picks are what my heart says.
What my brain says, is they will win the division, lose to the Braves
in the NLCS, and the Braves will win the Series against Minnesota.
But for now, I'll stick with the Cards all the way.
