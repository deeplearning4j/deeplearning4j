Could someone please do one of the following:
1. Point to an init that allows me to turn off power management on my
   Duo 210.
1. Write an init that would allow me to turn off ALL power management on
   Duo 210.
2. Point me to documentation on power management so that I can write such
   an init.
3. Explain to me why such an init is totally or partially impossible.

Ideally, of course, I would like to be able to turn in on and off on the
fly.

Surely such an init would be very helpful to Powerbook owners who want to
do MIDI... I cannot imagine why it is not possible to do, unless it requires
Apple to divluge some secret. And if that is the case, the surely APPLE
could write the init. (Unless Apple brings out new models so fast these
days that even THEY don't know how they work).
