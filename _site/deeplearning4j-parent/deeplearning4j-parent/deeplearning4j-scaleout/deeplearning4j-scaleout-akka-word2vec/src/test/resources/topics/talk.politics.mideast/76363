Anyone care to speculate on this? I'll let the rest of the net judge
this on its own merits. Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished 
of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only 
the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian 
Armenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of 
Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines 
genocide as acting with a 

  'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a 
   national, ethnic, racial or religious group.' 

History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate 
the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the 
Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including 
U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy 
as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of 
the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the 
extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor 
those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. 

The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established,
beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people
during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy
was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian 
territories.

The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and
their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed.
The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and
perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian 
Government.

The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were
Dro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri,
Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.

"I have it from absolute first-hand information that the Armenians in 
 the Caucasus attacked Tartar (Turkish) villages that are utterly 
 defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder
 the inhabitants, pillage the village and often burn the village."

"Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning
 with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken
 in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army
 withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian
 massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked
 in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places
 selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs
 were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after
 being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part 
 of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the
 cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering
 from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived
 in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.
 Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not
 exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in
 Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything
 that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them
 in a destitute situation. At the present time, the people are subsisting
 on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from Russian storages
 left behind after their occupation of this area."
