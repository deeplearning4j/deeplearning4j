A friend of mine got a Mag of the above model and it had some distrotion, so
he sent it back.  Unfortunately, the replacement also was distorted.  I would
bet it's a common problem.  The best advice I've heard when buying monnitors
is to actually look at the specific one you will buy (as opposed to model)
since monitor manufacturing even from "Big Names" still tends to produce
alot of monitors with visible defects.
