Pitt in 6. The Bruins arent a pushover.

Unless the Hawks can somehow change fate, you're right.  

Who knows, though.  Maybe some intensive forechecking aka normal Hawks
style will nullify a seemingly unbeatable team.  Maybe the Pens are due
for a let-down.  Hell, how could they _possibly_ extend their record
making play all the way through the playoffs.?
