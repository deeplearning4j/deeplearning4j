                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
                      AT SUMMER JOBS CONFERENCE

	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that 
Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today 
about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to 
get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature 
of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of 
people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of 
those who are here.  
	     
	     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education 
and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my 
good friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and 
all of the business and local community leaders from the city and 
county and state level from around America who are here. 
	     
	     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved 
hearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is 
their future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A 
year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because 
I was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our 
country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had 
too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines 
of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to 
take us into the future.  
	     
	     I entered with the hope that together we could create 
more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of 
our people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of 
America's community, knowing that together we could always to more 
than we could individually and that we might secure our future.
	     
	     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 
jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the 
commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, 
and those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs 
does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this 
stage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all 
those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're 
on the right track.
	     
	     Last July when I was traveling across America's 
heartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in 
Louisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business 
people who were participating in the Louisville Education and 
Employment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  
I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed 
both in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my 
own state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about 
-- that for millions of American young people it is really an 
impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good 
workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what 
is learning.
	     
	     In the world in which we are living, the average young 
person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a 
lifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning 
world much better.  And we must determine that all of our young 
people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased 
here today.  
	     
	     Whether you're in business or in government or in 
education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to 
building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all 
of our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things 
are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best 
thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have 
jobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  
	     
	     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty 
good education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that 
they'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either 
political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great 
challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to 
fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work 
for them to do.
	     
	     All the European countries have higher unemployment 
rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the 
unemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  
They're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its 
most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that 
I have proposed to create jobs. 
	     
	     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now 
about as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  
It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of 
pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing 
their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their 
people.  
	     
	     But it is especially important for America for two 
reasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move 
aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be 
competitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, 
even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed 
of the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to 
work in this country.  (Applause.)
	     
	     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some 
of it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and 
moving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We 
have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big 
organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they 
are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working 
at some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to 
create jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the 
chance to work.  
	     
	     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare 
reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of 
months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the 
end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  
(Applause.)
	     
	     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of 
the American people to perform without regard to race or income or 
the circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that 
there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their 
talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  
I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if 
you want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more 
responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this 
country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you 
have got to have opportunity in that mix. 
	     
	     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for 
every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules 
and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be 
something at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are 
basically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, 
recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of 
our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their 
background.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's 
something there for them to do?

	     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an 
integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of 
work and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people 
first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private 
sector.
	     
	     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in 
February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 
extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the 
American business community to meet that target so that we can create  
more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been 
created before.
	     
	     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And 
Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in 
this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more 
than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people 
a work experience.  And it is terribly important.
	     
	     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is 
part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the 
American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their 
jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving 
the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to 
college but do need at least two years of post-high school training 
either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, 
so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more 
people to go on to college who do want to go.
	     
	     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive 
plan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The 
emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would 
create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and 
that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It 
would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work 
force in jobs that otherwise will not be created.
	     
	      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to 
invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --
projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, 
new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities 
-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve 
the environment.  
	     
	     The summer jobs program is an important part of that 
because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the 
Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching 
out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer 
jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to 
hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young 
people into further educational opportunities and to further job 
opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component 
to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government 
has never fully emphasized before.  
	     
	     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because 
they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in 
difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building 
their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other 
areas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who 
have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what 
they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next 
year.  
	     
	     What we are trying to do here is to give people the 
opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning 
skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next 
couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school 
in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning 
environment.  
	     
	     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities 
for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this 
will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will 
be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new 
work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.
	     
	     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-
work jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding 
the job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help 
to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve 
local problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public 
buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in 
hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, 
and learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while 
they earn, but letting them earn.
	     
	     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people 
who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should 
do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the 
opportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing 
in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't 
exactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare 
system; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people 
to work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the 
use of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if 
you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to 
reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  
(Applause.)
	     
	     The young people we propose to put to work under our 
program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, 
reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will 
stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a 
sense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, 
but a challenge that will take them into a different life.
	     
	     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even 
as I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the 
summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll 
see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer 
academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved 
ahead.  I suspect that they will.  
	     
	     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I 
will be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn 
from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next 
summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school 
year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that 
we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so 
that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private 
investments as well. 
	     
	     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the 
business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this 
summer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business 
who have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who 
haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about 
this event today, I want to implore other private employers to 
stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this 
summer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when 
we don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort 
them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)
	     
	     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up 
here on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking 
about work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've 
done to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very 
foolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand 
and sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had 
ever had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be 
worth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     That does not mean young people should not be 
entrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation 
ahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and 
worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  
And I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some 
people say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  
	     
	     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I 
grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul 
without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a 
job.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to 
people is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a 
job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now 
I live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any 
more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're 
working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  
And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these 
young people want.
	     
	     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  
It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration 
pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private 
sector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn 
how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created 
in this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done 
off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a 
third or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do 
economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of 
America's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just 
kidding.  
	     
	     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy 
country in the world, including the United States, is having 
difficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done 
I'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole 
deliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the 
answers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  
(Applause.)
	     
	     And so the jobs program that I have presented to 
Congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the 
counties, through the Community Development Program, with the 
infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an 
attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the 
economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little 
boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a 
million jobs and maybe get the engine going again.
	     
	     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in 
the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government 
money.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American 
economy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind 
of system we have and it works pretty well.  
	     
	     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you 
here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends 
and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers 
to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the 
funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government 
should create this summer, so that together we can have this 
partnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a 
future -- a future that our young people can believe in.  
	     
	     We need to send them a message that here in America if 
you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute 
something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  
You can build a future from you own dreams. 
	     
	     That has always been the promise of America.  Together 
that's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of 
the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise 
has been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.
	     
	     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)
