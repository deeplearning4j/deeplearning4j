	Greetings. I received a reply stating that unless someone else
	confirms that the following company is operating, I should
	remove it from my lst:

>PCB Prototypes of Sandy, UT
>Ronald Baker
>8195 South 2660 East
>Sandy, UT  84093
>Tel: [read below]
	
	This is from the COMM_PCB.FAQ (commercial PCB makers).

	Also, I don't have time to get the FAQ onto the sci.answers
	because of what I like to refer to is "red tape" - after the
	finals, I'll see what I can do... in the mean-time, anyone know
	of an FTP site that wouldn't mind a 250K file? :-)

	And last, I have some new entries for the SIMUSOFT list (mostly
	commercial/institutional stuff) but was wondering: should I keep
	the restrictions on the price of the software to be considered ->
	under $600 or should I include all those in 4 digit prices also?

	Take care.
