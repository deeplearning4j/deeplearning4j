Proof by assertion!  I love it!  Uh, please explain why the smugglers
do not also rank a notch below (or above) the military in terms
of communications, intelligence gathering (e.g., why fight officials
when you can bribe them..."I'll give you a hundred grand to let that
semi past..."), and firepower.

What's the point here?  You're arguing that the black market
WORKS (which it does, of course).

This is the wrong way to quantify things.  The smuggler would
be concerned about value/cubic foot.  Go to a gun show and
price out a crate of good quality handguns.

What's "local?"

What is a worthwhile firearm?  Hell, anything that WORKS!  Go
get yourself a copy of the Army's 1969 Improvised Munitions Manual.
See how easy it is to make a functional firearm.

If paying $10 for inconspicuous parts at the local K-Mart is
"through the nose."
