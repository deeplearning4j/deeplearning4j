>Brady regarding Texas state carrying concealed legislation:
>
>   "A handful of lawmakers in Austin today have told the public that
>their safety is of less importance than the interests of the National
>Rifle Association.  This action comes as local, state and federal law
>enforcement officials continue their stand-off with a religious cult
>that has highlighted the need for tougher gun laws, not weaker ones
>like the carry concealed bill.

   "A handful of anti-gun zealots are telling the public that their
right to self-defense is of less importance than the interests of
Handgun Control, Inc.  This action comes as local, state and federal law
enforcement officials continue their assault on the Branch Davidian
compound--an assault which has already resulted in the death of one
two year old child at the hands of federal agents.  This has highlighted
the need for citizens to be able to defend themselves and their children
against the excesses of their own government."

>   "Any suggestion by proponents that this bill will help to reduce
>crime is a distortion of the facts, at best.  This so-called
>crime-fighting law has resulted in a 16 percent increase in violent
>crime in the state of Florida, and I have never heard law enforcement
>officials bragging that more guns on the streets is the way to reduce
>crime.

  "Any suggestion by opponents that this bill will increase crime is a 
distortion of the facts, at best.  The aggressive outreach by officials
in central Florida to train and arm women has led to a dramatic drop in
the level of assault and rape in that area.  Of course, this program is
a rare gem, as many law enforcement officials apparently believe that an
unarmed citizenry will be easier to control, and thus favor tighter 
restrictions."

>   "The vote today is an insult to the law enforcement officials who
>are putting their lives on the line every day to end the standoff in
>Waco.  The entire country now knows just how easy it is for an
>individual bent on destruction to amass an arsenal of weapons.  Texas
>lawmakers who voted for this concealed handgun bill have shown total
>disregard for those law officials on the front lines, and the
>families of those who have fallen.

   "The vote today is a tribute to the good sense of the public at large
who are putting their lives on the line every day as they go about their
lawful affairs.  The entire country knows how vulnerable the average 
citizen is, both to attacks from criminals and from armed assault by our
own police.  Texas lawmakers who voted for this concealed handgun bill have
shown total understanding for those innocent, law-abiding citizens on the
front lines, and the families of those who have fallen."

>   "I urge the House of Representatives to listen to the 70 percent
>of Texans that oppose this measure, and reject this ill-conceived
>legislation."

   "I urge the House of Representatives to pay attention to the needs
of their constituents, and not be stampeded by ill-conceived arguments
from ideological fanatics."
