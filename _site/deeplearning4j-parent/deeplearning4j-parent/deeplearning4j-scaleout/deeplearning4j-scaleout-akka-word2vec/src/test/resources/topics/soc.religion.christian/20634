As a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran - it is some of the
"innovations" of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and return
to the more traditional Catholic Chuch - the Lutherans.

I spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate in
the Catholic Church and I found it very meaningful.  Our Lutheran parish just
instituted the "Tenebrae" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for 
a paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned things
that I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those "facts" were
always there.  As a matter of interest, the pastor and I were talking about
the differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week over
breakfast Easter Sunday.

My wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called music
and worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committee
but listens very carefully to the committee's suggestions.  It needs a strong
hand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong
as it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additional
reason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual
guidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA "wishy-washy".
 
As you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir-
regardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotes
the true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in a
traditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament
of PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.
The reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings
are not shared by everyone.

I want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don't want 
them attending a show.  It's not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful
service during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of
Worship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such
as the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it
is Not there.

Quite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and "fit in".
My dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils
would intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics who
have beared with me this far understand what I mean.

Please keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Not
to worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is something
wrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest or
pastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldn't listen.  They are there to 
provide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.  My differences with
the Catholic Church are much more fundamental - but my decision to change
faiths was done with prayer, intervention, and sessions with priests and
ministers.

In Christ,
Kershner
