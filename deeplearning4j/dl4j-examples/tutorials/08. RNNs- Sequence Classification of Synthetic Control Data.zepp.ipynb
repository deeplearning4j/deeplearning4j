    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks (RNN's) are used when the input is sequential in nature. Typically RNN's are much more effective than regular feed forward neural networks for sequential data because they can keep track of dependencies in the data over multiple time steps. This is possible because the output of a RNN at a time step depends on the current input and the output of the previous time step. \n",
    "\n",
    "RNN's can also be applied to situations where the input is sequential but the output isn't. In these cases the output of the last time step of the RNN is typically taken as the output for the overall observation. For classification, the output of the last time step will be the predicted class label for the observation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will show how to build a RNN using the MultiLayerNetwork class of deeplearning4j (DL4J). This tutorial will focus on applying a RNN for a classification task. We will be using the MNIST data, which is a dataset that consists of images of handwritten digits, as the input for the RNN. Although the MNIST data isn't time series in nature, we can interpret it as such since there are 784 inputs. Thus, each observation or image will be interpreted to have 784 time steps consisting of one scalar value for a pixel. Note that we use a RNN for this task for purely pedagogical reasons. In practice, convolutional neural networks (CNN's) are better suited for image classification tasks. \n",
