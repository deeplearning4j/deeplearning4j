Well, I'm not sure I'd go quite that far, but I agree that Motorola
gear is of better quality.  The question is how much that quality
is worth to a ham in amateur service, not commercial service

Ok, great. But how often does that come up?  How good is
"good enough", and how much is someone willing to pay for it?
A good ham-quality HT is maybe $500, while a commercial
quality one is maybe $2000. Is the increased reliability and
performance worth 4 times the price *in amateur service*?
Only the individual involved can answer that question, and each
ham has to decide for him/herself.  If Motorola quality is worth
4 times the price to you, then more power to ya'. But I'm amazed
that folks make that choice. For, me, given that I've got $2000 to
spend, I'l pick the Yaesu ht and a nice new HF rig every time over
a Motorola ht alone, no matter how good it is.  To me, ham-quality
gear is "good enough". To each his own...
