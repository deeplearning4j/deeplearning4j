   ~~~~~~~~~~FOR SALE as of 5PM 4/02/93~~~~~~~~~~

   1       AMIGA 3000UX    25mhz, unix compatible machine w/100 meg Hard
		   Drive, 4 meg RAM, no monitor, keyboard (ESC and ~ keys 
		   broken)
		   ASKING PRICE:   $1700 OBO.

Mind my asking why you're selling a used machine with a damaged
keyboard for the about the same price as a brand new A4000/030
(A4000-EC030/4 megs/120meg IDE HD/HD Floppy/v3.0 OS - $1899)?

I'd like to get an A3000 locally for something reasonable like less
than 1K without monitor.  Brand new the A3000-25mhz/50 meg HD/HD
floppy/2.1 ROM isn't running for more than $1400 or so.

Considering it's damaged, probabably has a real old version of the OS
I'll offer $700.  Don't laugh...my A2000 isn't worth more than
$250-$300 these days.
