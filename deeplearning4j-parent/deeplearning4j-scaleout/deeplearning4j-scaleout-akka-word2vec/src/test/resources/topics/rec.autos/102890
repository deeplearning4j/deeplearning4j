As long as we're on the subject... Several years ago myself and two others
were riding in the front of a Toyota pickup heading south on Interstate 5
north of Seattle, WA. Someone threw a rock of an overpass and hit our
windshield. Not by accident I'm sure, it was impossible to get up to the
overpass quickly to see who did it. We figured it was kids, reported it and
left.
A couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company. He was
in his mid-fourties and left behind a wife and children. Turned out there was
a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away. They caught the 14 year old
that did it. They put a cover over the overpass, what else could they do?
I don't think I'll over forget this story.
