It's not relevant whether I agree with you or not, there is some reasonable
thought in what you say here an I appreciate your point. However, I would make 2
remarks: 

 - you forgot about hate, and this is not only at government level.
 - It's not only 'arab' governments.

Now, about taugh talk and arrogance, we are adults, aren't we ? Do you listen 
to tough talk of american politicians ? or switch  the channel ? 
I would rather be 'intimidated' by some dummy 'talking tough' then by a 
bomb ready to blow under my seat in B747.
