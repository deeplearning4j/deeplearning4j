For the record, former NY Rangers coach Ted "Darth" Sator recently led
Lion Milan (Jari Kurri's former team, only the nickname's changed
[Devils->Lion]) to their second straight Italian championship. They made the
European Final Four last autumn after losing to Swedish champs Malmo in the
semis...and accomplished this feat using FIFTEEN Canadian-born players!! Mamma
