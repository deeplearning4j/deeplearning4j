Hmmmm, I'm not sure this is true.  According to Mike Lang and good old
Stagie, along with the rest of the TV crews in pittsburgh, they 
winning streak could have stopped because it is a regular season mark.
I would think this would also hold with an unbeaten streak for regular
season games.

However, you are right that the playoff streak does carry over from
last year.  And with 1 more win, I believe they tie an Edmonton record
(but don't quote me on that one).
