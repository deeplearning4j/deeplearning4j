I have a few minor problems with the article posted as proof of 
Christ's resurrection.  

First the scriptural quotations:

This sort of reasoning is such that if you beleive you are justified,
if not then your beleif is in vain, so you might as well beleive.  Most
of these quotations are of people who do beleive.  People who would
try to justify their own positions.

Second the logical proof:

 The period of time that has elapsed from the event growing larger
does not increase the odds that a hoax would be discovered.  In fact
the longer a hoax is perpetuated the stronger it becomes.

Finally:

There is no proof of the resurrection of Christ, except in our spirits
communion with his, and the Father's.  It is a matter of FAITH, belief
without logical proof.  Incedently one of the largest stumbling blocks for
rational western man, myself included.

I hope that this is taken in the spirit it was intended and not as a 
rejection of the resurrection's occurance.  I beleive, but I wanted to point 
out the weakness of logical proofs.
