Hi... I'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx
in advance)

I want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There
is this version of the bible I have read about and on the front page it says:
"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies."   

					Thanx in advance... Shaz....

[I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions.
The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style
of the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significant
differences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying
text.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by
hand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts
around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the
original, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are
generally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are
something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved,
but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there's
much uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians
believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of
translating is free of error.  But I also don't think there's
enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that
it has much practical effect.

Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot
topic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it
(though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details
that don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there
being multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in
all the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the
title page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've been
referring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get
referenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been
editions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes
everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into
single narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor
objects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible
has long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making
editions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions
that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from
a variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine
one of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all
inaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any edition
that's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is.
(Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a few
translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize
inconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there
are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best,
I'm afraid.)
