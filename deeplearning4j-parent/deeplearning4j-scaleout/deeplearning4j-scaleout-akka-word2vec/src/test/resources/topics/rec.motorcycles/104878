                 FOR SALE (RELUCTANTLY)
                  ---- Classic Bike -----
                 1972 YAMAHA XS-2 650 TWIN
 
<6000 Original miles. Always stored inside. 1979 front end with
aftermarket tapered steering head bearings. Racer's supply rear
bronze swingarm bushings, Tsubaki chain, Pirrhana 1/4 fairing
with headlight cutout, one-up Carrera racing seat, superbike bars,
velo stacks on twin carbs. Also have original seat. Tank is original
cherry/white paint with no scratches, dents or dings. Needs a
new exhaust as original finally rusted through and was discarded.
I was in process of making Kenney Roberts TT replica/ cafe racer
when graduate school, marriage, child precluded further effort.
Wife would love me to unload it. It does need re-assembly, but
I think everything is there. I'll also throw in manuals, receipts,
and a collection of XS650 Society newsletters and relevant mag
articles. Great fun, CLASSIC bike with over 2K invested. Will
consider reasonable offers.
