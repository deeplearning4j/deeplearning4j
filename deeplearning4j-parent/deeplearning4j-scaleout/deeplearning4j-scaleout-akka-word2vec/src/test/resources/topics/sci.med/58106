What does "DC" stand for?  Couldn't be an antichiropractic posting
from a chiropractor, could it?  My curiosity is piqued.

Prostate CA is an especially troublesome entity for chiropractors.
It so typically causes bone pain due to spinal metastases that it
gets manipulated frequently.  Manipulating a cancer riddled bone
is highly dangerous, since it can then fracture.  I've seen at
least three cases where this happened with resulting neurologic
damage, including paraplegia.  This is one instance where knowing
how to read x-rays can really help a chiropractor stay out of trouble.
DO chiropractors know what bony mets from prostate look like?
