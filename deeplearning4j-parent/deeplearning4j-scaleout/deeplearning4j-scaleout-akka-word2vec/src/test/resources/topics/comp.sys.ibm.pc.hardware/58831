It is model number #7033D, a 14" interlaced .28dp.  BTW, if you have a
number to contact the company, that would really be helpful to.  Thanks
for replying.  I was beginning to believe that I was never going to get
a reply.  I posted this on the netnews bboard because the first message
I sent to you was returned, and I didn't know if my second message would
get to you.
