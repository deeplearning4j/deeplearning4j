About two months ago I purchased the Adaptec ASW-410 driver for use with a
CD-ROM drive.  At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I
had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with
CD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a
major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver
(I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this
until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now
find that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled
correctly by the ASW-410 driver.

So, should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their
FAX number?

Any assistance appreciated.

Regards

BTW: everything else works fine, certainly seems that Sony have caught up with
     the rest with the 641.
