W.K. Gorman:

<3>> Maybe now's the time for us, the NRA, GOA, CCRTKBA, SAF, et al to band
<3>> together and buy CNN as *our* voice. Wouldn't that be sumpin....broadcast
<3>> the truth for a change and be able to air a favorable pro-gun item or two..

<3>I would like to see this happen. I don't think it will. I don't
<3>think the average gun-owner will take any notice of what is happening
<3>until they break down HIS door.

<3>BUT I will go on record publicly to the effect that I will contribute a
<3>minimum of $1,000.00 to the buy-out fund if it can be organized and made
<3>viable. Anybody else want to put their money where their mouth is?  :)
<3>There ar 50+ MILLION gun owners out there. If - and it's a big and
<3>not very realistic if - we got hold of CNN, the anti-gun bullshit would
<3>STOP RIGHT THERE. Why won't it happen - because nobody will get off their
<3>ass and MAKE it happen. Nuts.

Any NRA headquarters weenies listening to this man. Any RTKBA organization
honcho listening. It's time to stop fighting the Brady's and the Schumer's
(now there's an interesting meaning to the acronynm BS) from the comfort
of the office....we had better get serious with our time and money and get
after it or we might just as well pack it in now.
