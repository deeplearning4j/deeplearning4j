In some South American countries, after political undesirables disappeared,
the family would get a notice of death and a bill for the disposal
of the body.  You apparently think that would be a good idea.

The Federal Government initiated this action against Koresh and his
followers, surrounded them for 51 days, engaged in psychological
warfare, used heavy military equipment against US citizens on
US soil; and now that the compound caught fire while they were
pumping in CS gas after knocking holes in the building; disavows
all responsibility.  Big Brother is NOT always right.
