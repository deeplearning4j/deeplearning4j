  Which one?  The one yesterday, or has there been another?  If it was yester-
day, catch up.

  IMO, 90% of all "conspiracy" charges are easily explained by the simple
fact that in these days of instantaneous news transmission, all kinds of
stuff gets said when people really just don't know what the hell's going on.
Then the story changes once the facts are in and suddenly cries of "its all a 
whitewash!" start.  Naturally, everybody wants to cover his/her ass.

  Damnfino.  I just tend to take issue with absolute statements that are ob-
viously wrong on their face and tend to inflame, not inform.  The isolation
was significant, but not total.
