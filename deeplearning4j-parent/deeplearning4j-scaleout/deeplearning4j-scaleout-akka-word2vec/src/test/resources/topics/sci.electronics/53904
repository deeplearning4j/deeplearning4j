Well, they claim they are the only radio broadcaster with this
information.  But the city's cable channel (35 in CableVision areas)
shows this information map during travel times (6-9am and 4-7pm, I
believe).  Most of the major LA freeways are covered.  The
computer-generated map shows green, yellow, red, or flashing red
(respectively: <40mph, 25-40mph, >25mph, and "incident"--I might be off
a little on the speeds, since this is from memory).

I often look at this display in the morning to see if I really want to
fight the traffic on the Sepulveda Pass or work from home for a little
while to wait for it to clear.

Another poster explained the origin of the information: sensors (embedded
wire loops) in the pavement near ramps and every half mile or so.  CalTrans
has had a "big board" driven from this data in their traffic control center
for some time.  I don't know if they are selling the data or if anyone
with the equipment necessary for its transmission and display can have
it.
