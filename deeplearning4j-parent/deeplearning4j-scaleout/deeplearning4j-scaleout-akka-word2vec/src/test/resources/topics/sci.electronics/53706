    How about collecting them all together (IE everyones) and
    selling them as a lot?  The other thing is to give to a
    recycler.

    If they are free and you can send them real cheap!  I would
    be intrested in them.  hehehe  Are these 2 chip or 8 chip

    Why?  Do you use a RAM disk? :)
