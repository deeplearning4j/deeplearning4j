	Whats the difference between a V.32bis modem and a V.32bis modem?

Absolutely.  I just meant that no secure *dedicated* crypto device has
ever been given approval.  Guerrilla underground devices should be well
possible with today's high-speed modems (not that I can think of many v32bis
modems that are approved either mind you - just the overpriced Couriers)

Can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run
digital speech down 14.4K?  I think it is; I've heard it's not.  Lets
say 8 bit samples.  Would *raw* data at the corresponding sampling rate
be usable?  If not, how fancy does the compression need to be?
