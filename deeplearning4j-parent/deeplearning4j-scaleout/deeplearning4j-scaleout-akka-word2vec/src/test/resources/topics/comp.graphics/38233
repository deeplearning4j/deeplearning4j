	Yes, that's known as "Bresenhams Run Length Slice Algorithm for
Incremental lines". See Fundamental Algorithms for Computer Graphics,
Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg 1985.

	Hmm. I don't think I can help you with this, but you might
take a look at the following:

	"Double-Step Incremental Generation of Lines and Circles",
X. Wu and J. G. Rokne, Computer Graphics and Image processing,
Vol 37, No. 4, Mar. 1987, pp. 331-334

IEEE Computer Graphics & Applications, May 1989, pp. 56-69
