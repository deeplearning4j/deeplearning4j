Ho boy. There is no way in HELL you are going to be able to view GIFs or do
any other graphics in Linux without X windows!  I love Linux because it is
so easy to learn..  You want text?  Okay.   Use Linux. You want text AND
graphics?  Use Linux with X windows.  Simple.  Painless.  REQUIRED to have
X Windows if you want graphics!  This includes fancy word processors like
doc, image viewers like xv, etc.
