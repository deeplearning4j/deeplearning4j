     Are we talking about ColorView for DOS here?  
     I have version 2.0 and it writes the temp files to its own
     current directory.
     What later versions do, I admit that I don't know.
     Assuming your "expert" referenced above is talking about
     the version that I have, then I'd say he is correct.
     Is the ColorView for unix what is being discussed?
     Just mixed up, confused, befuddled, but genuinely and
     entirely curious....
