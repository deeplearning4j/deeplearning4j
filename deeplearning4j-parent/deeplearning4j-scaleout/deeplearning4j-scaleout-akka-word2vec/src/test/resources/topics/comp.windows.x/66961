I would suggest skipping olwm and getting olvwm instead. This version of the
olwm window manager implements a virtual desktop that I find really handy even
on large monitors. 

This version is also available at export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/olvwm3.tar.Z.
The README file also suggest getting the files in /contrib/xview3.

In my case, I built the X Server first, Xview second, then olvwm. All of these
were installed into /usr/X5. Once I verified the server worked correctly,
I happily issued "rm -rf /usr/openwin/*".

Using gcc 2.3.3 to build all of the above resulted in a windowing system that 
is, for all intents and purposes, identical to OpenWindows 3.0 and that is     
incredibly faster. There is a bit of tweaking you will have to do if you want
things to work _exactly_ like OpenWindows, but not much.
