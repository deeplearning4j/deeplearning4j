Well, yes and no.  I don't particularly want this discussion to spark
a lengthy debate, but I do think it's worth pointing out that "popular
usage" is not always sufficient excuse.  

In this case, for example, I think an appropriate parallel may be found
in the pronunciation of proper names: if people commonly misspelled or 
mispronounced your name, would you feel compelled to change it?  Probably
not.  

The same is true of X.  "The X Window System", "X", "X11", and related
monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a
proper name.  In fact, some of them are *trademarked* names.  The fact 
that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point.  

As for the trade publications that promulgate things like "X Window" or
"X.windows" or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees, 
consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by 
*journalists*.  Would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn't
be bothered to get the name of his/her source right?  Would you trust
a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong?

Popular usage is as it may be, but I for one am all for holding people
who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness.

X11 technically superior to NeWS?  Well, in *some* alternate universe
perhaps ...
