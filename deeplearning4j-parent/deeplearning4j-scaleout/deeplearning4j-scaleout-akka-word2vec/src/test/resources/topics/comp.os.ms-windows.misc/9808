Ok, I have a problem that I thought you guys/gals might know about....

I'm running a 286dx-25 with a 85mb hdd.  I also have windows 3.1, but
hardly any dos application will run out it.  Also, when I do a "mem"
command, it says that I have used up 58kb out of 640kb of conventional
memory, zero from upper level memory, and all 385kb of my ems memory.
And to top it off, I can't load any device drivers into upper memory.
Do I just need more memory?  Also, why would it use up ems memory instead
of upper memory?

Please reply by e-mail only to :  wes1574@tamvenus.tamu.edu
