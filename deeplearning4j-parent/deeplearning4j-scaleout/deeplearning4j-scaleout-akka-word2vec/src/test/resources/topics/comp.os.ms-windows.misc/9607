HI there!  I have a few games that I'd like to run under Windows 3.1 and can't
get the PIFS adjusted right.   For example Wing Commander.  In my DOS Prompt, I
have more than 620K available for programs.  This is enough to run WC.
So I build a PIF giving WC a couple of megs of extended memory etc.. and run 
it.  WC prompts: "Loading Wing Commander..." and then a message about 
"Using extended memory..." etc... and then my screen goes black (just before
the opening scene-the orchestra-would have appeared.)

I also have a pool game that does almost the same thing.  It opens up and
prompts me for what kind of video driver I have.  (CGA, EGA, etc...)  I
respond EGA and the screen goes black.   

On both of these a ctrl-alt-del getss me back to Windows.  

Has ANYONE run Wing Commander under Windows?  Or has had the problems I
describe and fixed them?   HEre's the rest of my setup:

	400MB Disk Free
          8MB memory   ~5 free during WIN session
        386DX-25
       
Respond here or on E-Mail.   If anyone else needs this info, send me mail in
a couple of days, and I'll forward the replies to you.
