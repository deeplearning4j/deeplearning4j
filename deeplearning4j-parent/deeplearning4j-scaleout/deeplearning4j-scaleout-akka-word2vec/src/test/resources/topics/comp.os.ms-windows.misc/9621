There is a way in SYS.INI to turn off RAM parity checking (unfortunately,
my good Windows references are at home, but any standard Win reference
will tell you how to do it. If not, email back to me.) That weird memory
may be producing phony parity errors. Danger is, if you turn checkling off,
you run the slight risk of data corruption due to a missed real error.
