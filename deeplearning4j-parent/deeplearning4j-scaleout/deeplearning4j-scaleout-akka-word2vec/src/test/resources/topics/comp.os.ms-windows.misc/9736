I have just noticed my FileManager doing something strange recently.
Usually, the line at the bottom of the FileManager (the status bar, I
guess) displays the total disk space and the total number of bytes for
the current selection.  If I select a whole bunch of files, I will get
an exact byte count.

Recently, I notice it incorrectly displays this count; it's truncating!
If I select a file that is, say, 532 bytes, it correctly displays '532 bytes'.
If I select select a file that is 23,482 bytes, it displays '23 bytes', 
not 23 Kbytes, just 23 bytes!  If I select 893,352 it will report only
893 bytes in the selection.  If I select over a Meg worth of files, say
3,356,345 it reports 3 bytes!  It's as if it's got a problem with displaying
more than 3 characters!

My system: 486DX/33, 8M memory, Stacker 3.0, DOS 5, Win 3.1.  I've run
the latest virus scanners (scan102, f-prot) and they didn't report anything.
Could I have unknowingly altered something that controls the formatting
of the status bar in the FileManger?
