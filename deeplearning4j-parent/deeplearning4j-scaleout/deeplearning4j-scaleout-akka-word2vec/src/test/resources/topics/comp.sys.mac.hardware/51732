Anyone out there have a Sony 1304S?

I have one, and it's very nice, however - If I run it in 16" mode, the
picture won't
go very big. I end up with about 1" gap either side, and .5" top &
bottom. I suspect
an internal adjustment would fix this. Anyone tried it?

Another problem is sub-brightness: Areas that are meant to be black (or
off the main
raster) are not very black. The real raster is quite visible when the
screen is blanked.
This is not too severe, but it is just not as good as other Trini screens
I have
used. If I turn the brightness/contrast down so that the raster is not
visible, the
real image virtually disappears!

The raster size is just right if I use 1024*768, but 100dpi+ is a bit too
much!

Oh, and I am using a RasterOps 24XLi card.


Thanks
