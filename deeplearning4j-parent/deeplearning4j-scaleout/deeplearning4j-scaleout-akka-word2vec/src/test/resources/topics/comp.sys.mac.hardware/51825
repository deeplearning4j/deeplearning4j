Hi.  I am working on a project for my marketing class and I'd like to
ask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create a
marketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at
this point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a "full page" monitor
for laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed
by authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook
screen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you
would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,
technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen
and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR "full" height. 
The screen would probably be monochrome.
The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very
popular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word
processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient
to see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and
applications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could
hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.

Now, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really
need some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me
via email and let me know:
1. If you would consider buying a "full page" laptop screen
2. How much you would be willing to pay for it
3. Any helpful commentaries on the idea

Also, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful,
but who knows!), please send me some.

Thanks in advance!!!

-Mike
