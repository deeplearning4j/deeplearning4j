1) So what?

2) It will be interesting to see the reaction when 2.5million queers
   gather in Washington DC. After all if there are only 6million of
   us then this is an event unprecidented in history...

Don't forget that 25% had 20 or more partners....

And what did this study show for number of sexual contacts for those
who said they where homosexual? Or is that number to inconvient for
