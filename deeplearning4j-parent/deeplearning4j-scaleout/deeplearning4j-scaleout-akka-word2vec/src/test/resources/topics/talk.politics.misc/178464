     I am so tired about all this debate on how many gays there
are!  Such arguments are basically worthless, imho.  Would it 
really matter if it were millions of people who are regularly
denied access to housing, employment, and personal security or
even only one?  
    As for death threats, I happen to know from personal
experience that gay people are far more likely to receive
them based on political veiws or even personal philosophies
related to the issue of sexual orientation than are heterosex
uals. Not a week goes by that I personally or one of my friends
is not physically or verbally harrassed for even appearing to
be gay.  
     Everyone is garaunteed certain unalienable rights under
our current form of government in theory, yet every day 
gay people are victimized by their local governments, by
the police force, and by (for the most part) an uninformed
and ignorant public. Is this democracy? I don't think so.
   A society's sense of justice is judged on the basis of
the treatment of the people who make up that society.
All of those people. And yes, that includes gays, lesbians,
and bisexuals whose "crimes" have no victims, and who
are as varied and diverse as the society of wich they are
a part.
