    I bought the diamond stealth 24 a few months ago.  it seems to be a
great card especially with my multimedia presentations.  It runs graphics
and animation as well as some near full motion video very well.  The only
thing I can tell that it lacks is speed above 256 colors.  Its qualit in
between 256 and 16.7 million collors un unreal but you definitly
compromise speed.  It seems to be a great card for graphics and it comes
with some great software, but Im not so sure about the excelerator
part.  I used to own a paridise and it doesnt seem to be much faster
than that.  One thing I do like is that it loads its own vesa driver
from ROM at startup, (I think) because I have never had to load it for
links386 or any other programs that require special VESA drivers at
startup.
