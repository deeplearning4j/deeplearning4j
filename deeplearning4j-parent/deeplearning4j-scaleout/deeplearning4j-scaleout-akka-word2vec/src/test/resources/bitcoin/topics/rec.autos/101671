Personally, i wouldn't use the $1.29 product from KMart. I knew about
this previously, but this past weekend on PBS's MotorWeek Pat Goss 
(their resident tech type) discussed these products, and recommends
not using them (i.e, the non-isopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners).

Supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture
from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors.  And although the 
others (ethyl based) do clean injectors they also cause rubber 
components in the fuel system to deteriorate, and they don't mix well
with water to help remove it from the fuel system.

I use a product recommended by VW called 44K (by BG Products, Inc.).
It cost more about $14.00, but it is supposed to do the job without
the potential harmful side effects, and its results are supposed to 
last from 2k to 4k miles. I have also used Chevron's Techtrolene (sp?).

I can't say that i have noticed any difference using either, since i 
only use these product as a preventative maintenance item.
