I remember this happening on the I-75 through Michigan and Ohio several
years back. A group of guys in an old beater would rear end a car,
usually out of state or Canadians. You stop and they smack you with a BB
bat. At least they didn't kill you for the sake of a car.
I think the cops put out decoys and this calmed down for a while.

Vlasis, are you safe walking through Germany if you are a refugee ?
