How many people will actually put that money in the bank and keep it there for the
sole use of a automotive repair......maybe for people who have a hard time saving
money or don't want the hassle of  worrying about paying for everything the 
extended warranty is worth it.....for some people it is worth it...others not, and
for some the peace of mind knowing you won't have too many unexpected expenses
is enough.....if you drive a lot, your basic warranty can be up in a little longer than
a year....how many people can make the car payments as well as large repairs....

It may work for some people......
