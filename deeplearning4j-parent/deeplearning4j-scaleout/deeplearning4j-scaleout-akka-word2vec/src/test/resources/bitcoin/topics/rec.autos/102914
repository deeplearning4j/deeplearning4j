If I hear someone screwing with my car (ie, setting off the alarm) and
taunting me to come out, you can be damn sure that my Colt Delta Elite
will also be coming with me. It's not the screwing with the car that'd
get them shot, it's the potential physical danger. If they're
taunting like that, it's very possible that they also intend to rob
me and/or do other physically harmful things.

If they're just screwing around, no harm done. If they're bent on
mayhem, they will receive the cure for their lead deficiency; a
180gr. injection @1200 fps...there's no telling what today's violent
criminals will do. Death may be the most pleasant outcome...
