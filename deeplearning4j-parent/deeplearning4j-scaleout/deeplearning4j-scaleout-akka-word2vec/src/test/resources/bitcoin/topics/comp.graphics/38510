There is a new version of the RTrace ray-tracing package (8.2.0) at
asterix.inescn.pt [192.35.246.17] in directory pub/RTrace.
Check the README file.

RTrace now can use the SUIT toolkit to have a nice user interface.
Compile it with -DSUIT or modify the Makefile.
SUIT is available at suit@uvacs.cs.virginia.edu
I have binaries of RTrace with SUIT for SUN Sparc, SGI Indigo
and DOS/GO32.
Please contact me if interested.

****************************************

The MAC RTrace 1.0 port is in directory pub/RTrace/Macintosh
Thanks to Reid Judd (reid.judd@east.sun.com) and
Greg Ferrar (gregt@function.mps.ohio-state.edu).

****************************************

Small changes were done since version 8.1.0, mainly:

1. Now it is possible to discard backface polygons and triangles
   for fast preview...

2. The support program scn2sff has been reworked to use temp files.

****************************************

Here goes a short description of current converters from
CAD/molecular/chemistry packages to the SCN format.

The package programs are related as below (those marked with * have been
modified)

****************************************

The DOS port of RTrace is in pub/RTrace/PC-386 (rtrac820.arj,
utils820.arj and image820.arj). See the README file there.
Requires DJGPP GO32 DOS extender (version 1.09 included), which can be
found in directory pub/PC/djgpp (and in many sites around netland).
There are also demo scenes, manuals and all the source code...

Please feel free to get it and use it.
Hope you like it.

Antonio Costa.
