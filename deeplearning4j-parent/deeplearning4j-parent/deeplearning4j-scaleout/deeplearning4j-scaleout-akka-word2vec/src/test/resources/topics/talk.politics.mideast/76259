Many of you ask me whether I approve of severe human rights
violations by Arab States becuse I focus on Israeli human rights
violations.

Let's make things clear: My opposition to H.R. violations in Arab
States is total and without qualification. No Arab State is and can
claim to be democratic. No Arab state claims to be democratic.

I am born in Palestine (now Israel). I have family there. The lack of
peace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life.
I am concerned by Palestine (Israel) because I want peace to come to
it. Peace AND justice. 

If anybody has legitimate claims towards Arab states, he should present
his claims and ask for support. Jews who left Arab states are fully 
entitled to make claims and should do so, if they consider their case has
a merit. It is their basic right to return to these countries, if they
wish. If not, they should not complain and compare themselves to the
Palestinians who have been struggling for the right of return since
Israel was established and whose right is upheld by the United Nations
quasi totally. If Jews feel discriminated in Arab countries, they have a
legitimate claim that any decent person can and should support. 

Human rights violations by Arab States don't justify, legitimate nor
are the cause for Israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts.
Israeli breaches stem from the Zionist concept, which can only be
implemented by negating basic rights to Palestinians. 

Israeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical. The first
party has a state and the other has none. The first is an occupier and
the second the occupied. For any meaningful relationship to emerge, some
symmetry must be established. As long as Israelis and Jews don't realise
the necessity of a change of perspective towards the Palestinian people
and as long as Israelis and Jews don't want to exorcise their own
past towards the Palestinians (the Naqba of 1948, etc.) and refuse to
acknowledge that the creation of Israel was dependent upon the removal
of most Palestinian Arabs, there will be no base for a real trust.

When I read the first time the list of the 383 Arab villages
destroyed by the State of Israel in and after 1948, I got a shock. 
I hope others will be touched by this discovery and think about the
meaning of such massive destruction and destitution.
