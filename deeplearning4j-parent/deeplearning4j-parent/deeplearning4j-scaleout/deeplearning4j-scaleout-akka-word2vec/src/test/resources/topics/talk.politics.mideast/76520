I don't like this comment about "Typical" thinking. You could state
your interpretation of Exodus without it. As I read Exodus I can see 
a lot of killing there, which is painted by the author of the bible
in ideological/religious colors. The history in the desert can be seen
as an ethos of any nomadic people occupying a land. That's why I think
it is a great book with which descendants Arabs, Turks and Mongols can 
unify as well.
