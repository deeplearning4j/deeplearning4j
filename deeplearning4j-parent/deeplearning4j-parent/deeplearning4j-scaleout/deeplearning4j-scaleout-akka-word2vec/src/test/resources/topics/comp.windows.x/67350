I am glad and proud to announce the new mailing-list for the PD Motif C++
bindings. I got over 40 replies in about one week of people interested in
such a list, and the software has now been properly installed, so the list
is now up and running. For those interested in joining, please send e-mail
to that extend to 'motif++-request@cv.ruu.nl' or 'rvloon@cv.ruu.nl'.

The blurb everyone who joins gets follows, as well as the original 
announcement for where Motif++ can be obtained.

Enjoy!

Welcome to the Motif++ Mailing List!

The Motif++ mailing list is a mailing list dedicated to Motif++, the PD C++
wrapper library for Motif, where people can ask questions about Motif++, 
swap stories, and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the 
bindings. 

All requests of an administrative nature, like subscription, removal, etc.
should be directed to motif++-request@cv.ruu.nl

All e-mail sent to motif++@cv.ruu.nl will be sent to the entire list, so
please make sure when using 'vacation' type programs that will reply to
messages automatically, that the address for the mailing-list is excluded 
from auto-replies.

Enjoy!

Hello Motif World,

over the past half year there have been a lot of relatively minor changes to
the Motif++ bindings. Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have
been changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.

This is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will
incorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support
X11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.

Note to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this
distribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.

Here is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:

HISTORY

The University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation,
has developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++
classes. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through
member-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library
was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1.
However, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only
worked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no
longer actively supported by the University of Lowell.

I, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell 
bindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and
enhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the
general public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).

NEW RELEASE

I am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++
bindings. 

This release offers:

- Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support
- Support for Xbae widgetset 
- Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate
  progress in an application.
- Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake
		     and its config files on your site. I have tried to
		     provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable
		     for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely
		     tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you
		     have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma
		     release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude
		     of platforms to test the Imake-files on.
- Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs)
- An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted
  on Usenet.

WHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS

Ftp:

Anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.

Note:

Please be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large
files during working hours.

Also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this
is an old version of the bindings.

E-mail:

Those who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by
e-mail.

REQUEST

Those who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please
contact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of
bugs, a bug-fix of course ;-). 

MORE INFORMATION 

Contact me at "rvloon@cv.ruu.nl".
If you are desperate, then you can call me at
+31 30 506711 (that is Utrecht, the Netherlands; those within the Netherlands
call 030-506711).

Enjoy!
