Ain't got a pair of fatigues... and I don't blast people wandering aimlessly,
I ask them what they're doing there... I only blast people who display
obvious violent intent... like black-clad men with weapons climbing thru
second-story windows, or people who break down the door instead of knocking.
Or people who knock my house down with tanks and set it afire.  Sound 
familiar yet?

Riddle me this: Why the hell are the CONVICTED CRIMINALS in Ohio getting
the kid glove treatment, and the BD's are burned alive without a trial?
Put aside who started the blaze, I still think any decent shyster can 
make a case for cruel and unusual punishment, playing the sounds of
tortured rabbits over the loudspeakers (where's the SPCA in all this?)...

Oh, and that's Mister gun-toter SIR to you, bucko.  Just because you choose
to abandon your rights, leave mine the hell alone, thankyouverymuch.
