I just found out from my source that this article was a joke.  Heh heh..  
It seemed pretty damn convincing to me from the start -- I just didn't
notice the smiley at the end of the article, and there were a few other
hints which I should of caught.

Anyway -- I guess this 'joke' did turn out to resemble Clinton's true 
feelings at least to some extent.  

Sorry about that...
