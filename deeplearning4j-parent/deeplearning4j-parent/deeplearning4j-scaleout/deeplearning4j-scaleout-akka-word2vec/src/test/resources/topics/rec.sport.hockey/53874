I AM an Ulf (and Pgh) fan, and what pisses me off about the whole Adam Graves/
Ulf Samuesson debate is that Ulf plays hard-hitting hockey (nothing wrong with 
that) while Graves does what he does when the only way to win a game is to 
intentionally hurt someone (which bites!).

I thought they had instituted all kinds of new rules this season to stop crap 
like that?!?  Is it just me, or does the officiating just still stink to high
heaven?  IMHO, if they could get rid of the existing refs, and institute a new
system with more than one ref on the ice to keep an eye on the trouble-makers
then a lot of these things would stop, and then the game would be ruled by the
finnesse players:  Mario, Selanne, Bure, Messier, et.al...
