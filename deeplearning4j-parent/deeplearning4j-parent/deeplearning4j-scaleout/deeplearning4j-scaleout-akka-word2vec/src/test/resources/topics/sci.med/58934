   Once you have your hypoglycemia CONFIRMED through the proper 
   channels, you might consider ther following:

   1) Chelated Manganese   25-50mg/day.
   2) Chelated Chromium    400-600mcg/day.
   3) Increase protein through foods or supplements.
   4) Avoid supplements/foods high in Potassium, Calcium, Zinc.
   5) Avoid Vit C supplements in excess of 100mg.
   6) Avoid honey and foods high in simple sugars.
   7) Enjoy breads, cereals, grains...

   Discuss the above with your health practitioner for compatibility
   with your body chemistry and safety.
