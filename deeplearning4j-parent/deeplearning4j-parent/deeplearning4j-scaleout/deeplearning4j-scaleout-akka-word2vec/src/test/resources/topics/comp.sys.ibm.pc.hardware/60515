No cache.

Correct.

8kB.

Was it six instructions?

80486DX without the mathematical coprocessor (FPU).
>80486DX:  Probably sorta like 80386...

Actually, the 80486 you described above is 80486DX.
(There is no separate 80486 nor 80386, either).

This is for Intel processors. Does anyone have a complete
list with Cyrix and Ibm products?
