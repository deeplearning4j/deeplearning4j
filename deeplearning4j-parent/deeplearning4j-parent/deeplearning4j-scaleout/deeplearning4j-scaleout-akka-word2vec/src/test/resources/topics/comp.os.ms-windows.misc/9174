I don't believe IRQ5 is the problem. I tried a mouse on COM3, IRQ4 (the
usual place) and it still did not like it. Simply, Windows seems to only
support mice on COM1 or COM2. The funny part is, though, that
Microsoft's own mouse driver (8.xx) was quite happy with my mouse
sitting on COM3. Why can't Windows use the mouse driver, or at least
support COM3? :-)

I've tried this too. Actually, I wanted to be able to use my second
modem (COM3/IRQ5) from Windows. It still will not talk to that modem. I
created two profiles, AMSTRAD (for my Amstrad modem on COM1/IRQ4) and
MAESTRO (for my Maestro on COM3/IRQ5). It will not talk to the Maestro
at all.

Nor here. (Windows 3.0).

I've seen nothing like that. I've experimented with Logitech's mouse
driver too, with no sucess.

If you have a SoundBlaster Pro, it should support IRQ10 as well.
Finally, a board that supports IRQs >9. The only one I have (except my
IDE controller).
