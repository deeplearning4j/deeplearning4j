Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for!

V for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed up
the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster.
This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to
video memory.

Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making 
cards to fit in the other two. 

How about an VLB ethernet card? Move the data into the card at
130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at
just over 1Mb/s.

[ Do do however free the local bus for other cards ]

Some times you need fast busses and sometimes you don't!
