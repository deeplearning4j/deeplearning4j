	The American press routinely uses the word fundamentalist to
refer to both Christians and Jews.  Christian fundementalists are
often refered to in the context of anti-abortion protests.  The
American media also uses fundamentalist to refer to Jews who live in
Judea, Samaria or Gaza, and to any Jew who follows the torah.
