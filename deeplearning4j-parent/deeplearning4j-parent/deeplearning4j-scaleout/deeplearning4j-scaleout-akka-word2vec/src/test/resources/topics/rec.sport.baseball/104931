Not the first.  RFK, olim DC Stadium, was built 2 years earlier.
Nowadays they don't move the seats back for the few exhibition
games; but the 3rd-base/LF lower deck used to move.  It was all 
metal, which was pretty noisy on Bat Day.

It's vastly better than it was before they fixed it, though.  Back in
the late 70's it was a *dump*.
