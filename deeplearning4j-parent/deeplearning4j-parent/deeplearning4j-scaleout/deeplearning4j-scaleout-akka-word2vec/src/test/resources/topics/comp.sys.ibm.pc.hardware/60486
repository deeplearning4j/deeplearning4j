	Is it possible to have 2 Sound Blasters in 1 machine?
Would give your the equivalent of a SB Pro but with stereo Digitized sound.
The way Creative Labs price Pro's in Oz, the price is equal.

	I suppose you could set the I/O addresses to 220 and 240H
but what about the DMA channels?
	Any way what is this DMA channel sharing hype?  Does it share the
SB and hardisk DMA channels or something more esoteric?
