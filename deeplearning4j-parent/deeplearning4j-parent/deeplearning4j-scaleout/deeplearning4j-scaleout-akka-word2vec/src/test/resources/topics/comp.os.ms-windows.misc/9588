Hi there,
I'm having a bizarre video problem within Windows 3.1.  I have a 286 with
a GVGA-16 video board.  I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver
with other similarly configured computers.

I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen.

The problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors start
changing themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you open
a full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't have
any problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initially
return to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly.

Also, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, the
design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but
the white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc.

The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark
purple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the
screen gets refreshed again.

If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell
network, everything is fine.

I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the
other machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to this
machine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machine
and the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I tried
reloading Windows to no avail.

Any thoughts on things to check out?  I am totally baffled!

Thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction!
