In the UK, it's impossible to get approval to attach any crypto device
to the phone network.  (Anything that plugs in to our BT phone sockets

I was wondering some time ago how big a market there was for good old-
fashion acoustic coupler technology to build a secure phone :-) ... is

it strays into the mouthpiece?  Perhaps a well-sealed coupler attachment
that was as well blocked as possible, then a white noise generator on
the outside to muffle any real speech?
