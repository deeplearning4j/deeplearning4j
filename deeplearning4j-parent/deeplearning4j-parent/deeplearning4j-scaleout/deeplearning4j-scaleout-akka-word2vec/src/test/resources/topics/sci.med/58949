I am 35 and am recovering from a case of Chicken Pox which I contracted
from my 5 year old daughter.  I have quite a few of these little puppies
all over my bod.  At what point am I no longer infectious?  My physician's
office says when they are all scabbed over.  Is this true?

Is there any medications which can promote healing of the pox?  Speed up
healing?  Please e-mail replies, and thanks in advance.
