Subject: Problem: R5 server hangs on Sun3
Summary: annoying problem, server hangs
Keywords: X11R5pl22, sun3, bw2, 4.1.1, gcc-2.3.3, Xsun, Vernal Equinox
Organization: Univ. of Rochester, Dept. of Electrical Engineering
Lines: 19


I recently compiled the X11R5pl22 sources using gcc-2.3.3 on
a Sun3/80. Everything seems to work fine. Usually. But at
seemingly random times the server will just hang. I will
click the mouse somewhere (never happens while my back is turned),
and without warning, it will freeze there, requiring the server
to be killed. Sometimes it will run fine for weeks, sometimes
only for minutes.

(Os: 4.1.1; frame buffer: bw2).

Has anyone seen this before, any ideas? (anything at all?)

thanks,
