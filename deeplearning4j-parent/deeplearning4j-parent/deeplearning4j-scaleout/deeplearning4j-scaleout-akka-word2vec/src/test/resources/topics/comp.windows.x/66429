----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   1)! What books and articles on X are good for beginners?

	Ken Lee of SynOptics (klee@synoptics.com) regularly posts to 
comp.windows.x and ba.windows.x a bibliography containing cites of all known 
reference books and how-to manuals and also cites of selected technical 
articles on X and X programming; it is ftp-able as 
	export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xbibliography and 
	gatekeeper.dec.com:/pub/X11/contrib/Xbibliography

Here is an unordered set of the reference books and tutorials most useful for
beginners; most appear on that list [comments are gathered from a variety of 
places and are unattributable]:

Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., "X Window System Toolkit, The Complete
Programmer's Guide and Specification", Digital Press, 1990.  The bible on Xt. A
treasury of information, excellent and invaluable.  Distributed by Digital 
Press, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by Prentice-Hall,

Jones, Oliver, Introduction to the X Window System, Prentice-Hall, 1988, 1989.
ISBN 0-13-499997-5. An excellent introduction to programming with Xlib.  
Written with the programmer in mind, this book includes many practical tips 
that are not found anywhere else. This book is not as broad as the O'Reilly 
Xlib tutorial, but Jones is an experienced X programmer and this shows in the 
quality and depth of the material in the book. Originally written for X11R1, 
recent printings have included corrections and additions and current material.
 
Young, Doug. "The X Window System: Applications and Programming with Xt (Motif 
Version)," Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8). The excellent tutorial 
"X Window System Programming and Applications with Xt," (ISBN 0-13-972167-3)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   4)  What X-related public mailing lists are available?

	The xpert mailing list is the general, public mailing list on X
maintained by the X Consortium. The mailings are gatewayed, so xpert is almost 
identical to the comp.windows.x Usenet newsgroup. 

	***	If you get comp.windows.x, you don't need to 	***
	***	be added to the xpert mailing list. 		***

	Otherwise, you can join the list to receive X information 
electronically. It is best to find a local distribution; perhaps someone within
your company is already receiving the mailing. As a last resort, send mail to 
xpert-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with a valid return electronic address. 

	The xannounce mailing list carries major X announcements, such as new
releases (including public patches from MIT), public reviews, adoption of 
standards by the MIT X Consortium, and conference announcements.  It does NOT 
carry advertisements, source code, patches, or questions.  If you already 
receive the Usenet news group comp.windows.x.announce or the xpert mailing 
list, you don't need to be added to the xannounce mailing list.  Otherwise, to 
subscribe, send a request to xannounce-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu. Note: Only 
redistribution addresses will be accepted for this list -- i.e. no personal 
addresses. If you wish to receive xannounce yourself, please contact your mail 
administrator to set up a local redistribution list and to put you on it.  
	comp.windows.x.apps is not gatewayed to a mailing list.

Subject:   7)  How do I ask a net-question so as to maximize helpful responses?

	When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists, be sure to include 
all information about your setup and what you are doing.  The more specific you
are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without
all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are
able to respond at all.

	Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it 
from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system,
give details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S 
version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to 
mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.

	Then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what
you expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the 
exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote 
doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary 
(just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  10)  What is the ICCCM? (How do I write X-friendly applications?)

	The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the 
official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It 
describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with 
other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need 
to read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the 
selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window 
manager.  Get it either:
	- as part of the R4 distribution from MIT
	- in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys "X Window System" book
	- as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, "X Protocol
Reference Manual." A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.
	The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to 
the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the 
presentation.

[from David Rosenthal, 10/90]

	- the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's
"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5". The complete document is on the R5
tapes.

	Alternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in "RTFM" and is
the most-important of the least-read X documents.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?

	The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the
development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of 
cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software 
interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.
	MIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and 
administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the 
Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership, 
Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).
	Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail, 
with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape,
interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.  
Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with 
others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification
is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium
as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public 
review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.
	Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or 
Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.
	Write to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer 
Science, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.

Subject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?

	OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK
was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was
developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF 
members. 

	OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; 
there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications.
Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the 
one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce 
programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's 
(formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a "virtual toolkit" which provides objects in the
style of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.

	OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising 
their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.

Subject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?

	Open Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system 
that combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface 
specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including
the SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and
a number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).

[thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92] 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?

	DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI 
toolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a 
session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar, 
dxpsview, etc.).

(At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  15)  What is PEX?

	PEX is the "PHiGS Extension to X".
	PHiGS stands for "Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics 
System" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation 
and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in 
hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension 
allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized 
hardware for 3D graphics.
	Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely 
redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample
implementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release.
Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for 
their workstations and X terminals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  16)  What is "low-bandwidth X" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?

There are several options for using X over serial lines:

SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP
packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years,
and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations.
Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really 
ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per 
packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully 
so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). 

CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the 
40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do 
anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help,
but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed 
data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).

PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point
links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than
SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial 
line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for 
running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire
still needs compression somewhere to make it usable.

XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally
developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition 
to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes 
redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and 
using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a 
pseudo-X server or "proxy" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There 
are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:
   (1)	You don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't 
	otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly 
	connected), and
   (2)	It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that
	have to cross the serial interface, and
   (3)	In addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering 
	packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for 
	blocks to compress.

LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a
standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using 
NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX
will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information 
(e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, 
etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a 
Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample 
implementation available in R6.

Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how
LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu
in contrib/ in the following files:

Subject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?

	The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the
X window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is
no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways 
for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,
decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order
(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):

	wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3
	uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, 
although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.
	twm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window 
managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a
re-parenting window manager. 
	awm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers
some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers
	cwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. 
	rtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap
and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.
	dxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering
	hpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm
	mwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit
	tekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering 
	olwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style
Guide functionality
	olwm (AT&T): ditto
	gwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in
Lisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on
avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]
	m_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape
	pswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release
	swm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple
GUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes
from the resources file
	twm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked
twm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape
	vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a
single-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available
on archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available 
from export. [3/92]
	tvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm
and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is
available on archive servers
	olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is 
available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.
	mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version
is floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a 
source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].
	NCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look 
	XDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals 
	ctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 
twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export.
Version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.
	vuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.
	4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM
	piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?

	It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your 
window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X 
session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your 
window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in
the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:
		exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic
or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.
Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, 
whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?

	Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature --
which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the
geometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something 
close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are 
looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. 
Look for the application "xplaces" on an archive-server near you. There are 
several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage.
[10/90]
	Some new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the 
saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running
applications and the resource database. 
[Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?

	DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this, 
add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:
	sm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?

	You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using "xset r on|off". The X
protocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is
a capability not supported by all systems.
	Some servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide
command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over 
server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the 
server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server 
from MIT with the options "-ar1 350 -ar2 30" to reduce the sensitivity of the 
keyboard.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?

	There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be
produced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful 
for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and 
does not do "macro expansion."
	Some (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, 
accept a translation resource such as:
	xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \
		<Key>F1: string("setenv DISPLAY unix:0")
which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally
within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control
characters in the string, use \nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the
control character you want to include.
	Window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor
has a special "remapper" client been made available.
