One minor nitpick:  It is not a proposal.  It is a *DECISION* ... from their
point of view it is a DONE DEAL.  The chips are being manufactured, it
obviously has been budgeted, the whole thing.  THAT IS WHAT IS SO UPSETTING.
THIS WAS ALL DONE IN SECRET.  Because they DIDN'T want the people to know
what was going on until it is too late.

Otherwise, I agree with you 100 percent.

How come it always takes someone who has lived under the Eastern Bloc to
remind us about how precious and fragile our liberties are?

Please, keep up the good work.  Hopefully you will wake SOMEONE up...
