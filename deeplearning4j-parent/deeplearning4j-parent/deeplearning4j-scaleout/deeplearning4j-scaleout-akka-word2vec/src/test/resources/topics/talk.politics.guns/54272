I can't speak for the organizations you cited but everywhere you look in
our society and government, one can see the relentless movement toward
one world government.  The fact that the media demeans such charished 
values as patriotism, nationalism and protectionism are some of the
clues.  The fact that we are sapping the economic strength of americans
to prop up a former and possibly future enemy is just another.  The fact
the words like community of nations, global village and international
business are in vogue are others.  International corporations are 
destroying our identy and economy and the propaganda they are playing
through the media and government is over powering our ability to resist.
Our porous border both people and trade are an indiciation that we have
already lost a great deal of sovergnty.

The bottome line is that the single most evil aspect of One World
Government is that you have nowhere to run to and history has proven
that would be a disaster.  

Beware the LIBERAL and the conservative and the moderate.  Think for yourself
