You can probably get this information by calling your public health
department in your county (in Pittsburgh, they give the shots free,
as well).  There are bulletins in medical libraries that give
recommendations, or you could call the infectious diseases section
of the medicine department of your local medical school.  You also
will probably want to talk about Malaria prophylaxis.  You will
need your doctor to get the prescription.
