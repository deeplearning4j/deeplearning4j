I am looking for the following book, which I have
only seen as a paperback (I lent my copy to someone,
and forgetfulness has made that pronoun PERMANENTLY
indeterminate!).  I am looking for one OR two copies!

Title: The Nine-Mile Walk and Other Stories
        (unsure about the hyphen and the exact subtitle)
Author: Harry Kemelman (author of all the "Rabbi" mysteries)

It's a collection of short mystery stories.  Please email
mark@ocsmd.ocs.com OR call the 800 number given below.
Thanks!

- Mark
