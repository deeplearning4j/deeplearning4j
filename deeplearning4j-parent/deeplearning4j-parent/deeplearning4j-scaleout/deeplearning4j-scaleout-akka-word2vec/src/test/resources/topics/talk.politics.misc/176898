If you don't want to be lumped together as a group, stop insisting
on being treated as a member of a group.

Sexual orientation is not defined by the anti-discrimination law
that was passed last year.  Pedophilia isn't a sexual orientation?

I wholeheartedly support their right to take this action.  I wouldn't
do it myself, unless it was something like the NAMBLA T-shirt.

# How about:  a black man applies for a job at a bank.  The bank decides,

I support their right to do so (just like I support your right to 
engage in sodomy with consenting adults), but I think they are doing 
something wrong.  I wouldn't do business with such a bank.
