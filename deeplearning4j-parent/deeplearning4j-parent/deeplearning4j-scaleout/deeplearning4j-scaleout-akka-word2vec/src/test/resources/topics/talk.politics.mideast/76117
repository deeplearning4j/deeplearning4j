Dear friends,

I am a graduate student in Education at the University of Tennessee. As part of
the requirements for a research class in music education I designed a
questionnaire to colect data for my research project. The study intends to
determine which techniques (if any) have been used to teach music for the deaf.

If you have any experience in music education for the deaf and would like to
help me with this project, your help would be very much appreciated. 

If you also want to exchange some ideas about the subject matter, feel yourself
welcome. I have been working in this area for a while (in Brazil _ by the way,
I am Brazilian _ and also in US) and I am very pleased with the results.

I hope that this inquiry will not cause too many inconveniences. Thank you for
or time and consideration.

	Some school systems require music to be taught to deaf children, other
school systems have not thought of the possibility to teach music for children
with hearing limitations. The following questionnaire was designed to find out
how teachers face the issue of teaching or not teaching music for the deaf.
Also, a part of this study is to determine teachers attitudes towards music
programs for deaf children.

	DIRECTIONS:
	READ THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND CIRCLE THE NUMBER THAT BEST DESCRIBES
YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS MUSIC FOR DEAF CHILDREN (LEFT COLUMN), AND CIRCLE THE
APPROPRIATE "YES", "NO" OR "NOT APPLICABLE", WHETHER YOU DO THE TASK (RIGHT
