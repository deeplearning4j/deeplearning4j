Howdy

We have been having a real problem with an AST 386sx/16 machine with
4mb of RAM.  We installed Paradox for Windows, (but I don't think 
Paradox is the real problem here), and the installation went ok
(windows is installed on a local drive, paradox installed on a novell
network (netware 386 v3.26 or greater), DOS 5, Win 3.1) but the program
will not load in 386 enchanted mode.  The thermometer bar goes to 60%
and we then either get a 'invalid command.com' or a windows nastygram
talking about an illegal instruction.  I've checked out the command.com
thing, but as a long-time C programmer, I've crashed my share of machines
with pointer problems and this is a standard behavior :-)

Anyway, paradox will run in standard mode, but not enhanced.  We also have
quattro pro windows, exhibiting the same behavior.  Spent about 2 hours
with Borland's tech people, with no avail.  The guy I talked to a microsoft
didn't want to really dig in and help, as he gave up pretty quickly.
Somewhat disappointing, really.  I expected more from Microsoft.  You'd think
with all the millions of windows installations that they would have seen all
the possible problems, but I guess not...

Microsoft had sent us a 13 page fax on fixing UAE and General
Protection faults (sorry, I can't fax anything out of here so please
don't ask, try Microsoft), which we tried.  We did *everything* they
said, and still no luck.

So.  If you can help, please mail me.  This problem is driving us nuts.
I will greatly appreciate any information anyone can pass on.

Thanks

Kelly
