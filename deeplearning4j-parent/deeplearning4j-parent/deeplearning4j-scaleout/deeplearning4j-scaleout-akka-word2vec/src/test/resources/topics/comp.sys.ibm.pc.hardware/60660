--------------------

I am running a Unisys PW2 386SX20 with DOS 6.  My problem, even when I had DOS
5.0, is that when I have EMM386 loaded I can't CTL-ALT-DEL.  If I do, the
computer beeps a few times rapidly and hangs.  Then I have to use the obscure
reset (requires a screwdriver or pencil) or the power switch to reboot.  Does
anyone have a solution to this problem?

E-mail me at x51948b1@usma1.usma.edu
