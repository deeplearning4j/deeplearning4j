Aryans who do not base their reasoning on Nazi ideology are racists...

Thus spoke an American citizen in the name of Judaism. If this is Judaism,
I think Judaism should be combatted as any extremist and dangerous
philosophy.

I suspect however that Martin Buber, Albert Einstein and other Jewish
scholars would have rather converted to Christianity than stay Jews, if
they would have perceived Judaism as such a perverted philosophy.

Those who wish to learn something about the perversion of Judaism,
should consult the masterly work by Yehoshua Harkabi, who was many
years the head of Israeli Intelligence and an opponent of the PLO. His
latest book was published in English and includes a very detailed analysis
of Judeo-Nazism.
