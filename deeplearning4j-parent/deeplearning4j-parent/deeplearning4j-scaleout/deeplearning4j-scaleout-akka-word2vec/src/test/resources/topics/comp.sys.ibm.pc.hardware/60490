Hai,

In a few days I'm going to buy a new motherboard with local-bus(ses).
It comes with a Cirrus Logic VLB card which has 2Mb RAM onboard.
It can do true-color but I don't know what type of card it is.
I read that Cirrus Logic cards aren't exactly the fastes around.

My old system had a TSENG 4000. I was pretty pleased with it, so I
consider buying a W32/TSENG card. I'd like to know a few things:

	- How is the speed/performance in DOS/Windows/Unix/OS/2
	  Graphics & Text (also compared to S3 cards for example)
	- What resolutions (including no. of colors) does it
	  support (text & graphics)
	- How many RAM can be installed and what type of RAM
	- Compatibility with old TSENG 4000
	- Support in software

If anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) I'd like
to know. If you have a better alternative than the W32 please tell
me about it.


For the people in Holland:
Kan iemand me misschien vertellen waar de W32 in Nederland te verkrijg
is? Het liefst in de omgeving van Amsterdam!


Thanks in advance,			Erik Stel (estel@cs.vu.nl)
