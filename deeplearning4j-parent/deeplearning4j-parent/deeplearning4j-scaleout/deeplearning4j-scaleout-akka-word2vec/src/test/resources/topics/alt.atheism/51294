No cookies, Charlie. The claims that Jesus have been seen are discredited
as extraordinary claims that don't match their evidence. In this case, it
is for one that the gospels cannot even agree if it was Jesus who has been
seen. Further, there are zillions of other spook stories, and one would
hardly consider others even in a religious context to be some evidence of
a resurrection.
 
There have been more elaborate arguments made, but it looks as if they have
not passed your post filtering.

It is no evidence in the strict meaning. If there was actual evidence it would
probably be part of it, but the says nothing about the claims.
 
 
Charlie, I have seen Invisible Pink Unicorns!
By your standards we have evidence for IPUs now.
