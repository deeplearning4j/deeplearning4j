Praise God!  I'm writing everyone to inform you that I have been
accepted to the Doctor of Psychology program at Fuller Theological
Seminary in Pasadena, CA.  I've been working long and hard to try to
get in there and have said many hours of prayer.  I'm very excited for
this opportunity, but also very nervous about it.

I'd appreciate the prayers of the readers of this group for my preparation
for school this summer and for my career as a graduate student.  I'd also
appreciate any information any of the readers of this group might have 
about Fuller, Pasadena, or California in general, like good places to
have fun, good churches to check out, or anything else that might be
good for me to know.  Also, if anyone knows of any foundations that 
might have funding or scholarship money available, please let me know!
Of course, if you wish to make a personal contribution.....:)

The contract for my current job is over at the end of April.  I'll be
taking a couple classes at UT this summer and then I'll be moving to
Pasadena.  Hopefully, I'll be able to get net.access next fall, although
Fuller doesn't have it itself.

I've enjoyed the interesting discussions and I commend everyone for their
earnest search to please God.  Thanks to our moderator for providing
such a wonderful service and in doing a great job of running this news
group.

May God bless you all.  Vaya con Dios, mi amigas y amigos.

Paul
