My next project is to come up with an IF/detector module for fast -- 112
to 250 kB/sec -- packet radio use.  No fancy modulation scheme, just
wide FSK for use at 902 or 1296 MHz.

I'm a bit familiar with the Motorola 3362 chip, but I wonder if there
are newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies.

My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver "back
end" with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the other.  I'm
particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than 10.7 -- do any
current chips work up to, say 150MHz with internal downconversion so a
normal IF filter can be used?

Any suggestions?

John
