What I find so hard to understand is how come some people, apparantly
NOT connected with government or otherwise privileged, will
go to great lengths, redefinitions, re-interpretations, in a full-bore
attempt to THROW AWAY THE PROTECTION OF THEIR OWN RIGHTS under the
Constitution!!!

Almost makes me think of lemmings running into the sea during a lemming
year...

I really wonder that Jefferson and Madison would say to these folks?

Excellent quote.
