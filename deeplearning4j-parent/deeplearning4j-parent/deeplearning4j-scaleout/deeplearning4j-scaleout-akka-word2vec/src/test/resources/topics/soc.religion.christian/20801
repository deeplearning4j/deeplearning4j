Subject: Looking for videotapes
Lines: 44

I have been looking at some of the recent productions on homosexuality
and decided that I was interested in videotaped copies of these.  If
anyone can help me out here, I would very much appreciate it.

Here is what I am looking for:

* - "The Gay Agenda" produced by Ty Beeson's group The Report.

* - John Ankerberg's recent series "Understanding Homosexuality and
Experiencing Genuine Change."

* - James Kennedy's special on homosexuality which aired this week,
and the portion of the previous week's program which discussed "The
Gay Agenda."

I will not pay money for copies, since this is copyrighted material
and that would be illegal.  I will pay for return postage.  If
somebody can think of something they would desire in trade, please let
me know and I'll see what I can do.

Oh, BTW, I'm watching the March On Washington right now on C-SPAN. 
Other than the fact that I'm generally repulsed by what I'm watching,
I found one thing of interest.  General David Dinkins just finished
speaking, and remarked that the New York City delegation consists of
about 200,000 people.  Funny, I don't see 200,000 people out there,
period.  Must've been quite the party scene last night.  Or maybe
their exaggerations were just too much.

[I don't suppose you'd be interested in hearing about the homosexual
agenda from homosexual Christians?  These portrayals of the homosexual
agenda are regarded by some as being somewhat akin to trying to
understand fundamentalist Christianity by looking at the Branch
Dividians.  You might also want to look at some outside evaluations of
the groups claiming to change homosexuals.  When our church (the
Presbyterian Church (USA)) looked into this issue, even the
conservative members of the committee were concerned about how real
and long-lasting the changes were.  I'll be interested to get reports
from police and the press about the number of people participating
today.  Presumably we'll have a better idea by tomorrow.  --clh]
