Those areas became states.

Puerto Rico has the population needed to become a state.  But the ethnic
mix there is such that Puerto Rico will probably never become a state.

I say we cut them loose.  If they don't want to become a state, we
shouldn't continue to subsidize their existence.

  Liberal Handout right next to it.  Stop federal spending.  Cut the deficit.
