If life were so simple!  Savard has not played in three of the last 
four games and they are still playing like crap.  Montreal's problems
run deeper than Savard (and Mouton) unfortunately; I hope they can
get their act together before the playoffs.

The line-up in their game coming up against PittsburgH is said to be
the one they're likely to use for the playoffs.  Let's hope they can
forget about the nice weather we're having and play hockey.
