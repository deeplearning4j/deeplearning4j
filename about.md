# About Us

Eclipse Deeplearning4j is an open-source, distributed deep-learning project in Java and Scala spearheaded by the people at [Skymind](http://www.skymind.io), a San Francisco-based business intelligence and enterprise software firm. We're a team of data scientists, deep-learning specialists, Java systems engineers and semi-sentient robots.

There are a lot of knobs to turn when you're training a distributed deep-learning network. We've done our best to explain them, so that Deeplearning4j can serve as a DIY tool for Java, Scala and Clojure programmers working on Hadoop and other file systems. If you require support or customization beyond these tutorials, please contact us at [Skymind](http://www.skymind.io/contact/). 

Our open-core product, the [Skymind Intelligence Layer](https://skymind.ai/quickstart), bundles the Deeplearning4j suite of libraries alongside a Conda environment with Tensorflow, Keras, scikit-learn and other popular machine learning tools. SKIL makes it easy to perform distributed training, testing against production environments, and deployment of trained models to production.

## ND4J & ND4S

[ND4J is the Java scientific computing engine](http://nd4j.org/) powering our matrix manipulations. (See its [Github repo here](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/).) [ND4S](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4s) is its Scala wrapper.

## Media

Deeplearning4j has been featured in [Wired](http://www.wired.com/2014/06/skymind-deep-learning/), [GigaOM](http://gigaom.com/2014/06/02/a-startup-called-skymind-launches-pushing-open-source-deep-learning/), [Businessweek](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-06-03/teaching-smaller-companies-how-to-probe-deep-learning-on-their-own), [Venturebeat](http://venturebeat.com/2014/06/02/skymind-launches-with-open-source-plug-and-play-deep-learning-features-for-your-app/), [The Wall Street Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/06/03/the-morning-download-apple-relies-on-ecosystem-for-innovation/), [Fusion](http://fusion.net/story/177825/privacy-conscious-siris-that-dont-give-up-your-secrets-are-coming/) and [Java Magazine](oraclejavamagazine-digital.com/javamagazine/may_june_2015?sub_id=DJ9kzXBnuXELe#pg58). DL4J workshops are offered through [GalvanizeU](http://www.galvanizeu.com/) in San Francisco.

## Support

Without the engagement of Skymind customers and community, and the generous backing of Skymind's investors -- [Tencent](http://www.tencent.com/en-us/at/managementteam.shtml)'s investment team, led by David Wallerstein; [Liquid 2 Ventures](http://liquid2.vc/); [Mandra Capital](https://angel.co/mandra-capital); [SV Angel](http://svangel.com/); Ullas Naik; Wei Guo and others -- Deeplearning4j would not exist in its present form.

# Jobs @Skymind

We hire from our open-source contributors. The best way to apply for a job building the future of deep learning with us is to join our community on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j), fork us on [Github](https://github.com/deeplearning4j), find a problem to work on with us, and we'll can see if there's a fit! Working together is more informative than interviews, and with a little luck it's also more fun. :)
